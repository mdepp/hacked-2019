But the logistical changes have slowed deliveries across the country, causing shortages and long lines at service stations.\nImage\nOne of those wounded by the blast \u2014 there were at least 74 \u2014 being transferred to a helicopter. Villagers, including families, had gathered to scoop up fuel from the breach.\nCredit\nAlfredo Estrella/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images\nMr. L\u00f3pez Obrador, who visited the area early Saturday, insisted that the disaster showed why his strategy was more necessary than ever: Fuel theft not only inflicts financial damage on the nation, but it also exacts a deadly toll.\n\u201cWe have to continue with the plan to end fuel theft,\u201d Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador said during a news conference later at the presidential palace in Mexico City. \u201cWe will not stop. We will eradicate this.\u201d\nThe fuel theft crisis is an early test of Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s efforts to combat the country\u2019s worsening security landscape. He has said he intends to both strengthen the nation\u2019s security apparatus and address underlying social issues, such as inequality and poverty.\nLast Wednesday, the lower house of Mexico\u2019s Congress approved the creation of a 60,000-member national guard composed of police officers and military personnel to handle the nation\u2019s public security tasks, including its fight against organized crime. The proposal has been widely criticized by opposition parties and human rights activists who say it represents a further militarization of policing.\nFriday\u2019s explosion, which occurred in a rural, impoverished part of the state of Hidalgo, was particularly deadly because the breach in the pipeline created by criminals had also lured hundreds of villagers from the municipality of Tlahuelilpan, drawn by the promise of free gasoline.\nThat section of pipeline had been among the parts of the fuel transportation network that had been temporarily shut as part of the government\u2019s strategy to curb theft. But the flow through the tube resumed on Friday, just hours before thieves punctured it, officials said.\nImage\nA forensic technician works at the site of the pipeline explosion.\nCredit\nHenry Romero/Reuters\nGov. Omar Fayad of Hidalgo told reporters that his state, like others, had suffered fuel shortages as a result of the government\u2019s strategy.\nResidents who gathered at the explosion site on Saturday said that while opportunism had prompted some residents to flock to the illegal pipeline tap on Friday, many others were compelled by the shortages created by the government crackdown.\nVillagers, they said, were desperate to find gas for their personal use.\n\u201cIf there hadn\u2019t been such a bad shortage, this tragedy would not have happened and innocent people would not have died,\u201d said Ra\u00fal Linares, 30, a farmer. \u201cPeople didn\u2019t have a way to move around, get to their jobs, go anywhere.\u201d\nImage\nA forensic expert with burned remains on a stretcher. Videos and photographs circulating on social media showed people engulfed in flames running away from the blaze and victims screaming for help after the explosion on Friday.\nCredit\nAlfredo Estrella/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images\nHe added: \u201cWe agree with fighting fuel theft, but not this way because it is us who ultimately paid the price.\u201d Mr. Linares said one of his nephews was badly burned in the explosion and another was missing.\nVideos taken before the blast showed a raucous atmosphere at the site, with villagers from Tlahuelilpan, including families, laughing as they filled plastic jugs, pails and canisters with the gasoline, which gushed from the break like a geyser.\nIn the footage, military personnel who had rushed to the scene can be seen standing by and observing the throng that had converged on the pipeline, which connects to the nearby Tula refinery operated by the government-run oil firm Petr\u00f3leos Mexicanos, known as Pemex.\nImage\nVillagers arguing with the military to allow them to search for their missing relatives.\nCredit\nHector Vivas/Getty Images\nMexico\u2019s defense secretary, Luis Cresencio Sandoval, said that about 25 troops were on the scene, but the contingent was not large enough to turn back the 600 to 800 villagers who had swarmed the site. He said that his troops tried to persuade residents to retreat but their entreaties were ignored, and some of the people turned \u201caggressive\u201d toward the soldiers.\nAbout two hours after the authorities learned of the break, the fuel ignited, causing a huge explosion and sending flames and clouds of smoke into the sky. Videos and photographs circulating on social media and broadcast on Mexican news channels showed people engulfed in fire running away from the blaze and victims screaming in pain and wailing for help.\nThe fire took more than four hours to extinguish and left a blackened scar in the landscape.\nIt was the deadliest pipeline explosion in Mexico in recent memory. In 2010, at least 27 people were killed, scores injured and numerous homes destroyed in a blast in San Mart\u00edn Texmelucan de Labastida, a city in the state of Puebla. That, too, was caused by an illegal siphoning effort, officials said.\nImage\nFirefighters work to extinguish the blaze in Hidalgo State in Mexico on Friday night.\nCredit\nFrancisco Villeda/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images\nOn Saturday afternoon, forensic investigators and military police officers were examining the scene as scores of residents watched. Some villagers said they hoped to glean information about missing relatives.\n\u201cWe are all mourning today,\u201d said Angela Perez, 54, two of whose neighbors were among the dead. Ms. Perez theorized that many villagers who had flocked to the pipeline rupture wanted to get gasoline to resell.\n\u201cBut it was a foolish mistake,\u201d she said. \u201cLook what happened.\u201d\nFuel theft has been a longstanding problem in Mexico that, until recent years, was mostly written off by the government as a business cost, analysts said. But the problem began to worsen about a decade ago as organized crime groups started to diversify their portfolios.\nImage\nVillagers in Tlahuelipan tried to identify the bodies of people killed. The promise of free gasoline had drawn scores of residents to the breach in the pipeline.\nCredit\nHector Vivas/Getty Images\nRising international fuel prices made the crime increasingly attractive. The crime groups co-opted officials at all levels of government using bribery and violence, and won support among impoverished local populations with a steady supply of low-cost, black-market fuel and offers of relatively lucrative employment as lookouts and fuel couriers.\nMuch of the theft occurs through taps drilled under the cover of darkness into pipelines that carry fuel from the nation\u2019s ports and refineries to distribution centers across the country. Though much of the pipeline system runs underground, thieves operating in remote regions and doing quick work with shovels have been easily able to unearth the pipes. They have generally used high-powered drills to perforate the pipes, installing taps to siphon the fuel.\nThe problem has worsened in recent years. During the first 10 months of last year, the authorities discovered more than 12,500 illegal taps \u2014 nearly double the number discovered in all of 2016 and more than 27 times the number a decade ago.\nIn a news conference on Saturday morning, Octavio Romero, the general director of Pemex, said that in the past three months, thieves had drilled at least 10 holes in the same pipeline that exploded on Friday, also causing fires.\n\u201cOil theft does not only gravely affect our country\u2019s economy,\u201d Governor Fayad said in a statement to The New York Times. \u201cToday the state of Hidalgo is crying because of this tragedy, which has taken so many people\u2019s lives. Such regrettable events should never happen again in Mexico.\u201d\nHe said the death toll could climb even higher.\n\u201cMany of the gravely wounded are battling between life and death,\u201d Governor Fayad said.\nThe governor also appealed to the public to help the authorities curb the fuel-theft epidemic, calling on Mexicans \u201cto help us fight this widespread phenomenon and to stay away from pipelines that have been seized or ruptured.\u201d\nMr. L\u00f3pez Obrador, who took office on Dec. 1, said about $3.14 billion in fuel had been drained from the system last year and sold on the black market. As part of the crackdown, he has deployed about 4,000 military and police personnel to guard the nation\u2019s fuel infrastructure.", "headline": "Death Toll in Mexico Blast Rises to 73; Leader Vows to Intensify Crackdown on Fuel Theft", "blurb": "One of those wounded by the blast \u2014 there were at least 74 \u2014 being transferred to a helicopter.

Order!\u201d in that undrownoutable voice, something like an air-raid siren with postnasal drip.\nHe doled out his pompous, antiquarian insults, cheerfully rebuking one member for \u201cchuntering from a sedentary position ineloquently and for no obvious purpose.\u201d\nThe outside world rarely takes much notice of the speaker of the House of Commons, a nonpartisan and typically low-profile figure who presides over parliamentary debates. But Britain\u2019s last-minute paralysis over exiting the European Union, or Brexit, has made Mr. Bercow into a kind of celebrity.\nWith less than 10 weeks left before the country is set to leave the bloc, he has broken precedent by wresting some control over the Brexit decision-making from Prime Minister Theresa May, allowing Parliament to act to stop the country from leaving without a deal.\nThis has won him the admiration of Europeans \u2014 a French radio station named him \u201cEuropean of the Week.\u201d Clips of his signature cry, \u201cOrder, Order!,\u201d have gone viral on social media.\nBut it infuriated Mrs. May\u2019s team, which on Friday threatened Mr. Bercow with the most supercilious of punishments: blocking his entry to the House of Lords \u2014 an honor bestowed on every speaker for more than 200 years.\nImage\nThe son of a cab driver from North London, Mr. Bercow propelled himself through the Oxbridge-educated upper reaches of British society by sheer determination and is viewed, variously, as a sharp-elbowed bully and a champion of the rights of Parliament.\nCredit\nAndy Rain/EPA, via Shutterstock\nIt is an extraordinary moment for Mr. Bercow, the 56-year-old son of a cabdriver from North London. An outsider sometimes mocked for his short stature (he is 5 foot 6\u00bd), he propelled himself through the Oxbridge-educated upper reaches of British society by sheer determination and is viewed, variously, as a sharp-elbowed bully and a champion of the rights of Parliament.\nThose personal qualities have come into play at a pivotal moment as Britain hurtles toward its March 29 exit with a government in stalemate.\n\u201cHe is a law unto himself,\u201d said Bobby Friedman, the author of a biography of Mr. Bercow, recalling the speaker\u2019s decision on Jan. 9 to allow Parliament to amend a government business motion on Brexit. Business motions give the executive power to determine what happens in Parliament and when, and have not been considered changeable by Parliament.\n\u201cFrom a political geek\u2019s point of view, it was pretty astonishing,\u201d Mr. Friedman said of Mr. Bercow\u2019s decision. \u201cHe said, \u2018I\u2019ll do what I like.\u2019 If anyone else was speaker, it would have been incredibly surprising. With him, not particularly.\"\nEven in the hyper-loquacious environment of British politics, Mr. Bercow stands out for his love of ornate language and withering insult.\n\u201cHe could never say, \u2018It\u2019s great to see you\u2019 \u201d; instead he would say, \u2018It gives me inestimable pleasure to meet you for the finest condiments created by Mrs. Twinings,\u2019 \u201d a colleague told Mr. Friedman, his biographer. A sitting lawmaker told The New York Times in 2013, \u201cIt\u2019s as if he goes to bed every night, reads a thesaurus, inwardly digests it and then spews it out the next day.\u201d\nOccasionally, when a fellow politician was speaking, he would cry out, \u201cSplit infinitive!\u201d\nMr. Bercow has made a career out of annoying his conservative colleagues. Some are still seething over his decision not to wear the traditional speaker\u2019s regalia, including wig and knee-breeches, which he said created \u201ca barrier between Parliament and the public.\u201d\nImage\nMr. Bercow and his wife, Sally, a Labour Party activist, at Wimbledon in 2017.\nCredit\nShaun Botterill/Getty Images\nBut nothing has approached the fury that followed his decision to allow lawmakers to amend a business motion \u2014 effectively curbing the government\u2019s powers.\nThe British speaker, unlike his American counterpart, is required to drop his party affiliation and remain neutral on matters of policy.\nCrispin Blunt, a lawmaker from the conservative Tory party, protested that Mr. Bercow could no longer claim to be a neutral arbiter on the issue of Brexit and should step down. Another Tory, David Morris, complained that Mr. Bercow had displayed a bumper sticker with an anatomical epithet relating to Brexit.\n\u201cMr. Bercow denies claims that his car displays a sticker, saying the vehicle belongs to his wife,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut it may as well be stuck firmly to his puffed-up chest on this occasion.\u201d\nMr. Bercow said he voted in 2016 to remain in the European Union, but insisted that he was not taking sides on the issue now. Instead, he said he was standing up for the right of Parliament to challenge a bullying executive.\n\u201cI understand the importance of precedent, but precedent does not completely bind, for one very simple reason,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we were guided only by precedent, manifestly nothing in our procedures would ever change. Things do change.\u201d\nMr. Bercow would not comment for this article.\nIan Dunt, a political commentator who opposes Brexit, said the government has sidelined Parliament throughout the process, claiming that the referendum had provided the executive with a more direct form of sovereignty.\nImage\nWith less than 10 weeks left before the country will leave the European Union, Mr. Bercow has broken precedent to let Parliament wrest some control over the process from Prime Minister Theresa May.\nCredit\nJack Taylor/Getty Images\nHe compared this moment to 1642, when King Charles strode into the House of Commons and demanded that five lawmakers be arrested for treason. The speaker at the time, William Lenthall, refused his orders, telling the king in a famous speech that he acted solely on behalf of the House of Commons.\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing now is one of these big moments of constitutional change,\u201d Mr. Dunt said. \u201cWhen you start thinking about the scale, you do start thinking about the English Civil War.\u201d\nMr. Bercow is the grandson of Jack Bercowitch, who emigrated from Romania to the East End of London at the age of 16. His father, Charlie, ran a used-car business, and then, when it was forced to close, drove a cab.\nFriends and neighbors described John as an opinionated boy who occasionally irritated his grade schoolteachers by contradicting them in class, wrote Mr. Friedman in the biography \u201cBercow, Mr. Speaker.\u201d\n\u201cHe spoke like a politician at the age of 10,\u201d said Ashley Fuller, a tennis partner. \u201cHe\u2019d come in and see my father and say, \u2018Mr. Fuller, have you heard what\u2019s in The Times on page 3? It\u2019s outrageous, I have to show you.\u2019\u201d\nHis precociousness and small stature did not ingratiate him to schoolyard bullies. Mr. Friedman said they threw him into a pond, laughing and saying, \u201cBercow can be in there with the other amphibians.\u201d In university, \u201cwe\u2019d quote Monty Python and he\u2019d quote\u201d the 19th-century Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli, Andrew Crosbie, a fellow Tory activist, told Mr. Friedman.\nHe found his tribe in politics, a profession where his verbosity was an asset.\nAs a young man, he aligned himself with the far-right wing of the Conservative Party, at one point promoting the \u201cassisted repatriation\u201d of immigrants, an odd position for the grandson of Jewish immigrants.\nImage\nMr. Bercow in his office at The House of Commons in London in 2013.\nCredit\nLynsey Addario for The New York Times\nA fellow activist from that era recalled him memorizing and reciting whole speeches by Enoch Powell, a Tory lawmaker widely accused of inciting racism. Later in life, Mr. Bercow distanced himself from that movement, calling his own views at the time \u201cbone-headed.\u201d\nMr. Bercow scrapped his way up. He was so intent on entering Parliament that he hired a helicopter so that he could attend candidate selection meetings \u2014 typically sleepy, provincial affairs \u2014 in two constituencies on the same night.\nIn 2009, he became speaker of the House of Commons \u2014 the first Jewish lawmaker ever to hold that post. He resigned from the party, as is customary, when he became speaker. His politics had migrated to the left; he was married to a Labour activist, Sally, and many of his own party members spoke of him with open loathing.\nDavid Cameron, then the prime minister, once mocked Mr. Bercow in front of a crowd of journalists, joking that, at the upcoming royal wedding, the speaker would intervene by yelling, \u201cOrder! I want to hear what the prince is saying.\u201d\nHe lampooned Mr. Bercow\u2019s height by likening him to one of the seven dwarves, recounting an exchange in which the speaker declared, \u201cI\u2019m not happy!\u201d and a junior health minister replied, \u201cWell, which one are you?\u201d\nInsults became a central mode of communication between the speaker and the Tories.\nThe health minister called Mr. Bercow a \u201cstupid, sanctimonious dwarf.\u201d Another government minister, Andrea Leadsom, asked to nominate candidates for the \u201cbest villain\u201d of the political year, described \u201can incredibly annoying little creature that squeaks a lot and has found a place in the corridor outside my office.\u201d She then hastened to add that she was referring to a mouse, not Mr. Bercow.\nMr. Bercow, meanwhile, sneered at Mr. Cameron for his privileged background, remarking that \u201cEton, hunting, shooting and lunch at White\u2019s,\u201d an exclusive St. James\u2019s gentleman\u2019s club, did not qualify him to lead.\nMr. Bercow is said to have a temper and has been accused of bullying his staff, something he denies. An independent inquiry last fall suggested that he should step down. He has signaled that he will leave his post this year.\nThe events of the last week have won him praise from unusual quarters. The Times of London, calling him \u201chardly a sympathetic individual,\u201d wrote approvingly of his actions, saying the government\u2019s treatment of Parliament \u201chas appeared drawn from the 17th century, frequently invoking the will of the people, much as the early Stuarts used to assert the divine right of kings.\u201d\nAs for Mr. Bercow, he does not pay much attention to his critics, he told The House Magazine in 2012.\n\u201cThey scribble away and the world goes on,\u201d he said. \u201cI have no plans to die tomorrow but if I die tomorrow I will die a very happy man.\u201d", "headline": "\u2018Order!

Libya is the principal springboard for most African migrants seeking to enter Europe, and before they even set to sea, the migrants face other dangers like traffickers and violence.\nThe dingy set out on Thursday from the coastal town of Garabulli, Libya, west of Tripoli, and in about 10 hours started deflating and taking on water, survivors told humanitarian workers.\nWhen an aircraft from the Italian Navy on a security and surveillance mission spotted the craft 50 nautical miles northeast of the Libyan capital, the vessel had already started sinking, the Navy said in a statement, and roughly 20 people could be seen on board.\nThe rescue effort comes in a fraught political environment, with several European governments questioning the motives and behavior of independent rescue groups, and some bringing criminal charges against them.\nThe Italian Navy said that, after launching two inflatable rafts toward the migrants, it immediately called another helicopter to provide support, as their closest vessel was well beyond 110 nautical miles from the shipwreck.\nThe helicopter rescued the only three survivors and brought them to the hospital on the island of Lampedusa.

But they fell out after an intense power struggle and have been enemies ever since.\nMr. Kaczynski soon came to believe that the revolution had never been completed. By agreeing to a bloodless transition that allowed some Communist figures to remain in public life, he believed political leaders had failed to eradicate the Soviet infection.\nHe formed Center Agreement and, ultimately, Law and Justice, which had a brief turn in power from 2005 until 2007.

But soon, the tragedy was seized upon by Jaroslaw Kaczynski, who placed it at the center of the party\u2019s mythology of martyrdom and aggrieved nationalism.\nNow, instead of evoking a national tragedy, the word Smolensk is a marker of tribal identity.\nMr. Dudek, the conservative political scientist, said, \u201cI have friends, highly intelligent and very-well-educated folks, who sincerely wish Kaczynski\u2019s death.\u201d\nHe said the state television network, TVP, firmly under the control of the ruling party, is the lead promoter of bile with its coverage of the killing and the current climate; it has laid blame for the latter at the feet of opposition lawmakers.\nThousands of protesters rallied outside TVP\u2019s headquarters in Warsaw on Thursday night, calling for its director to be fired and \u201cto stop the propaganda of hate.\u201d\nImage\nScouts standing at an urn before Mr. Adamowicz\u2019s funeral.\nCredit\nSean Gallup/Getty Images\nThe broadcaster has since toned down its coverage, but Mr. Kaczynski has refused calls to remove the director.\nEven if the killing of Mr. Adamowicz proves to be the irrational act of madman, there is fear that the increasingly heated rhetoric could translate to violence.\nSince Monday, the police have detained nearly two dozen people who had either promoted violence or had threatened public figures. A special team of 105 prosecutors has been established to investigate hate crimes.\nThe mayor of Gdansk had been the frequent target of right-wing politicians and journalists, who portrayed him as an immoral criminal who would let terrorists into Poland and represented a threat to the nation.\nMr. Adamowicz, who was first elected mayor in 1998, dedicated himself to combating what he saw as the forces of hate and intolerance. During an interview at his office last spring, he said it was his goal to show the world that the Poland of Mr. Kaczynski was not the only Poland.\nImage\nA memorial for Mr. Adamowicz in Gdansk.

Her party had lost in key local elections, imperiling her run for a second term next year.\nBut then she got help from an unlikely source: the president of China.\nIn a speech this month to the people of Taiwan, a self-ruled democracy that Beijing considers Chinese territory, President Xi Jinping said the island \u201cmust be and will be\u201d united with China and warned that independence efforts could be met by armed force.\nMr. Xi\u2019s speech raised anxieties in Taiwan that Ms. Tsai was able to tap into by delivering a rebuke of Mr. Xi\u2019s proposal, in a rare departure from her usual cautious ambiguity.\n\u201cDemocratic values are the values and way of life that Taiwanese cherish,\u201d she said, \u201cand we call upon China to bravely move toward democracy.\u201d\nMs. Tsai\u2019s approval ratings surged after her speech, according to Taiwanese news reports. She also appeared to reassert her influence within her party with the appointment of an ally, Cho Jung-tai, as chairman this month.\nThe revitalization of Ms. Tsai\u2019s political prospects highlights the challenge that the increasingly authoritarian government in Beijing faces in offering a political formula for unification that would be attractive to Taiwan\u2019s vigorous democracy.\nMost of Taiwan\u2019s 23 million people are in favor of maintaining the island\u2019s de facto independence without taking any formal moves that might bring a military response from China. Still, Taiwan has tended to push back against threats from Beijing.\nMs. Tsai\u2019s response \u201clooked very presidential\u201d to many Taiwanese, said Hans H. Tung, an associate professor of political science at National Taiwan University. He said it also earned Ms. Tsai greater support from her Democratic Progressive Party, which leans toward independence.\nIt was a notable turnaround after Ms. Tsai\u2019s party lost several crucial mayoral elections in November to the opposition party, the Kuomintang, or K.M.T., largely because of unhappiness with how her government has handled economic issues.\nThe losses led Ms. Tsai to resign as party chairwoman, making her less certain to be the party\u2019s candidate in the presidential election next year.\nImage\nA television in New Taipei City showing Mr. Xi giving a speech earlier this month.

Ms. Li said she had until recently been disappointed with Ms. Tsai\u2019s unwillingness to prioritize same-sex marriage, an issue she had campaigned on before she was elected in 2016.\n\u201cIn terms of changing Taiwan\u2019s situation for the better, I really can\u2019t think of anyone out there more capable than Tsai Ing-wen,\u201d Ms. Li said.\nExpressions of encouragement for Ms. Tsai have flooded Taiwanese social media, with one viral post portraying her as a mother defending her child from a bully. Hundreds of female doctors from across Taiwan took out a front-page advertisement in two local newspapers urging readers to support Ms. Tsai.\nIn a joint declaration last week, representatives of Taiwan\u2019s aboriginal peoples also challenged Mr. Xi\u2019s assertion that Taiwan is part of China.\n\u201cTaiwan is the sacred land where generations of our ancestors lived and protected with their lives,\u201d their letter read. \u201cIt has never belonged to China.\u201d\nMr. Xi\u2019s speech also helped Ms. Tsai by dealing a blow to the opposition Kuomintang, which favors closer ties with China and is Beijing\u2019s preferred dialogue partner.\nAt the heart of the Taiwan dispute is the so-called 1992 Consensus, an unwritten agreement between Beijing and the Kuomintang government that monopolized political power in Taiwan at that time. That agreement holds that there is only one China, which includes Taiwan, but that both sides can define \u201cOne China\u201d in their own way.\nFor Beijing, that means the People\u2019s Republic of China. For the Kuomintang it is the Republic of China, Taiwan\u2019s official name.\nMs. Tsai has refused to endorse the 1992 Consensus at all, leading Mr. Xi\u2019s administration to suspend official contacts with her government.\nIn his speech, Mr. Xi also said that in the event of peaceful unification Taiwan would be administered under the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d political model China uses to govern Hong Kong, a territory where there are concerns about shrinking freedoms under Mr. Xi\u2019s rule.\nAnalysts say Ms. Tsai skillfully used Mr. Xi\u2019s speech to equate the 1992 Consensus with Beijing\u2019s \u201cone country, two systems\u201d formula. That has put the Kuomintang on the defensive over its support for the 1992 Consensus.\nImage\nThe changing of the guard at Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall in Taipei.

The model provides the territory with some autonomy from Beijing, allowing Hong Kong residents more freedom than citizens in the rest of China. But the space for pro-democratic activism and freedom of expression has shrunk in recent years.\nIn China, Ma Xiaoguang, a spokesman for the Taiwan Affairs Office, said Wednesday that the 1992 Consensus and the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d model were not the same thing. \u201cThe leadership of the D.P.P. has mixed up these two purposefully to misguide the Taiwanese people,\u201d Mr. Ma said, referring to Ms. Tsai\u2019s party.\nZhu Songling, director of the Institute of Taiwan Studies at Beijing Union University, said that a \u201cone country, two systems\u201d arrangement for Taiwan would not have to replicate the one in Hong Kong.\n\u201cThe \u2018two systems\u2019 for Taiwan can be negotiated,\u201d Professor Zhu said. \u201cHow do you know that \u2018one country, two systems\u2019 does not suit Taiwan even before starting a negotiation?\u201d\nBut Ms. Tsai\u2019s rejection of \u201cone country, two systems\u201d appears to have support in Taiwan that stretches across party lines. The Kuomintang\u2019s chairman, Wu Den-yih, said in a speech last week to party members that the 1992 Consensus was \u201cunrelated\u201d to the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d model proposed by Mr. Xi.\nWayne Chiang, a Kuomintang legislator whose great-grandfather, Chiang Kai-shek, was the longtime president of the Republic of China, praised Ms. Tsai\u2019s emphasis on the need for Beijing to respect Taiwan\u2019s democracy and freedom. For that, Mr. Chiang was criticized by fellow members of the party and its supporters.\nMr. Chiang also dismissed Mr. Xi\u2019s proposal. \u201cTaiwan is not Hong Kong,\u201d he told reporters last week. \u201cThe majority of Taiwanese people also find it impossible to accept \u2018one country, two systems.\u2019\u201d\nAnother Kuomintang legislator, Jason Hsu, went even further, saying in an interview that Mr. Xi\u2019s speech showed that the 1992 Consensus was no longer viable for his party as an approach to relations with China and that the Kuomintang needed to think of a new strategy.\nIt is unclear if the current wave of support for Ms. Tsai will improve her chances at re-election, given that it changes little about the domestic challenges she still faces.\n\u201cThe question is whether the boost in Tsai support will be only temporary,\u201d Ms. Glaser said.\nBut she noted that China\u2019s threats against Taiwan tended to benefit the party that is more critical of Beijing.\n\u201cThe people want a government that can protect them from outside threats when they feel insecure,\u201d she said.", "headline": "Faced With Tough Words From China, Taiwan Rallies Around Its Leader", "blurb": "A television in New Taipei City showing Mr. Xi giving a speech earlier this month.

Bolton, who left the country without meeting with Mr. Erdogan. Infuriated by comments Mr. Bolton had made in Israel that Turkey would be forced to ensure that Kurdish forces were protected, Mr. Erdogan canceled a proposed meeting.\nMr. Graham met with Mr. Erdogan for over two hours, and described it as a \u201cdirect and productive meeting\u201d on Friday.

Defense Minister Hulusi Akar, who also met with Mr. Graham on Friday, said in a statement that the United States had not kept its promises to remove YPG forces from Manbij and promised that Turkey would continue to combat terrorism along its border.\nAs he prepared to depart on Saturday, Mr. Graham said there was a way to mitigate the worst fallout of a swift American withdrawal: \u201cThere is no excuse to play it poorly.\u201d\nContrary to Mr. Trump\u2019s declaration, the defeat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, had not been completely achieved yet, he added.\n\u201cIf you walk away, ISIS will come back and create a nightmare,\u201d Mr. Graham said in an interview. Turkey\u2019s strategic concerns had to be taken into account, and Iran kept from seizing Syria\u2019s oil fields, he added.\nHe said that Mr. Trump\u2019s plan for a withdrawal could be achieved, but with more time for planning. The 2,000 United States special forces troops in northeastern Syria could be withdrawn and replaced with a new mission and a smaller force to ensure the Islamic State did not resurface and prevent the Syrian government and Iranian forces from taking over the territory, he said.\nMr. Graham has long criticized the United States\u2019 policy of arming and training the Kurdish People\u2019s Protection Units in Syria, also known as Y.P.G., saying that it works against the interests of Turkey, which is a strategic ally of the United States and NATO. The Y.P.G. is affiliated with the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party in Turkey. The United States and Turkey have both designated that group a terrorist organization, saying that it works against the interests of Turkey, which is a strategic ally of the United States and NATO.\nTo withdraw and leave the Kurdish fighters with weapons supplied by the United States was \u201cinsane,\u201d the senator said.\nTurkey would be driven to take military action inside Syria, creating a broader war, he said. \u201cThat would be putting Turkey in a terrible spot,\u201d he said in an interview ahead of the briefing. \u201cThat can all be avoided if we slow this down.\u201d\nGen.

Both France and Britain have units in Syria.\nMr. Graham said the most important step to prevent a broader war and a Turkish invasion was to ensure that the road map for the city of Manbij in northern Syria went ahead. Under that plan, Y.P.G. forces would withdraw and a local council acceptable to all sides, including Turkey, would take over the city\u2019s administration.\nThe United States could move away from what Mr. Trump has called the \u201cendless war\u201d but still meet national security objectives to \u201cprotect an ally from a problem it created,\u201d he said.\n\u201cYou can do all that with smaller forces, partnering with others,\u201d Mr. Graham added. \u201cIt would be a new mission, but the idea that Syria is not strategically important to the United States I completely reject.\u201d", "headline": "In Turkey, Senator Calls for Slower, Smarter U.S. Withdrawal From Syria", "blurb": "President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey met with Senator Lindsey Graham, third from left, in Ankara on Friday.", "lat": 39.9215219, "lon": 32.8537929, "location_string": "Ankara, Turkey", "referenced_places": [{"name": "Turkey", "lat": 38.9597594, "lon": 34.9249653}, {"name": "Iraq", "lat": 33.0955793, "lon": 44.1749775}, {"name": "United States", "lat": 39.7837304, "lon": -100.4458825}, {"name": "France", "lat": 46.603354, "lon": 1.8883335}, {"name": "Israel", "lat": 30.8760272, "lon": 35.0015196}, {"name": "Iran", "lat": 32.9407495, "lon": 52.9471344}, {"name": "Syria", "lat": 34.6401861, "lon": 39.0494106}]}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/19/world/europe/womens-march-europe.html?partner=rss&emc=rss": {"content": "ROME \u2014 Women of all ages, and some men, took to the streets in a dozen cities around the world on Saturday, the anniversary of the 2017 Women\u2019s March that served as a strong rebuke of President Trump\u2019s policies.\nThe annual marches and rallies have taken on wider themes since then, such as challenging the rise of the far right, while also calling for an end to inequality, the gender pay gap and violence against women.\nSome events were organized in response to a call from the United States to create a \u201cWomen\u2019s Wave.\u201d But others were held independently, and in many cases, the core message was that women\u2019s rights are about more than Mr. Trump.\nIn cities across the United States, women braved subzero temperatures in some parts of the country to march even as accusations of anti-Semitism have rocked the movement and prompted questions about its future.\n[Read about the U.S. marches, underscored by divisions and celebrations.]\nThe rallies in European countries like Germany and Italy included warnings of bleak times because of the rise of populism and the far-right.

Vox has also questioned official data about domestic violence and wants to unwind gay rights in a country that was among the first to allow same-sex marriage, in 2005.\nThe protests involved about 45 women\u2019s associations and took place in 50 cities.

Germany quickly opened up files left by East Germany\u2019s Stasi secret police after reunification in 1990.\nBut only Latvia was left with a systematic index listing the real and code names of more than 4,000 purported agents, along with a large digital archive of K.G.B. activities known as Delta.\nSo instead of clearing the air, a vote by Latvia\u2019s Parliament that the contents of the bags be posted online has confronted the tiny Baltic nation with an unsettling question. Is it slowly coming to terms with the fact that its people were not just victims of Soviet oppression but, in some cases, also eager collaborators? Or has it fallen prey to a devious plot by the K.G.B. to sow disarray among the country\u2019s post-independence elites with fabricated records of betrayal?\nImage\nFor many Latvians. the appearance of their names, code names and dates of recruitment in a recently released K.G.B. archive has come as a traumatic surprise.\nCredit\nAkos Stiller for The New York Times\nThe latter view is widely held by those who have been outed as agents but insist they had never knowingly worked for the K.G.B.

Although red wine has been grown in this part of Germany for centuries, it is only recently that it has become good enough to fetch premium prices.\nA 2016 bottle of Sp\u00e4tburgunder from another vintner in the area, Keller, fetched nearly $800 at auction recently, making it the most expensive modern German red wine.\nThe shifting climate may create not just new wines, but new wine regions. A study of average summer temperatures done by the Potsdam Institute of Climate Impact Research predicts that by 2040, most of Germany will be suitable for wine growing. Thirty years ago, only certain parts of the country\u2019s south had the right conditions.\nAlready, vineyards are popping up around Berlin. Since 2010, wine has been harvested on a 10-hectare site on the island of Sylt, just miles from Germany\u2019s northern border with Denmark.\nProducing slightly more than a quarter-billion gallons a year, Germany is one of the smallest of Europe\u2019s major wine-producing countries, making about a fifth as much as Italy, the largest (Spain and France are a close second and third).\nThose figures are likely to change more slowly than the climate does: The expansion of commercial vineyards is tightly regulated by European Union and national laws, and is tied to the current scale of production. So while shifting weather may favor the growth of the German wine sector, laws will keep it much smaller than the European behemoths.\n\u201cWhen it comes to wine, you really have a case where the change might be positive,\u201d said Manfred Stock, a scientist at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research.\nImage\nVineyards in Herxheim, a village on the German Wine Route.\nCredit\nLena Mucha for The New York Times\n\u201cThe northern border has moved,\u201d he said, noting that vintners started to notice a shift in climate as early as the 1980s.\nBut vintners in Germany also see downsides to climate change. Mr. Niewodniczanski says the warmer weather has also made it increasingly difficult to produce the most classic of German wines \u2014 the dry, light, fresh Riesling.\n\u201cWe ignored it at first because it was so good for the quality of the wine,\u201d said Prof. Monika Christmann, the head of Geisenheim University, one of three German universities specializing in wine, about the negative effects. \u201cBut now it\u2019s becoming a touch too much.\u201d\nGrapes ripen so well on traditional fields that the resulting wine is either too sweet or too alcoholic, since the level of alcohol is determined by the sugar levels in the grapes. Harvesting the grapes before they are fully ripened does not solve the problem, says Mr. Niewodniczanski, because it affects the flavor.\nMr. Niewodniczanski has invested millions into recultivating the Geisberg, steep land (on a slope 55 to 65 degrees) in a narrow valley that is less warm while receiving the same amount of light. It was abandoned in the 1960s as not favorable enough for commercial wine production \u2014 now Mr. Niewodniczanski hopes the 12 acres will yield some of his important grapes.\n\u201cThe Geisberg is an example of the importance of climate change,\u201d he said.\nAnd while the new summers tend to be hotter and more favorable to grapes, they are also more chaotic, meaning vintners have to deal with freak weather effects.\n\u201cThere is no bad wine any more \u2014 the only variability is the amount we harvest,\u201d said Mr. W\u00fcrtz, who predicts that his vineyard, St. Antony\u2019s, will produce three to four times the amount of wine it produced last year, when his region suffered late frost and an August hailstorm.\nIn total, Germany is predicted to have a harvest increase of 33 percent in 2018, according to European Union figures.\nAs for the 2018 vintage, Mr. W\u00fcrtz knows there will be a lot of it and that the grapes that produce it will be sweet, but he refuses to say it will actually be the best wine he has ever produced until it has aged.\n\u201cIt\u2019s always a surprise with wine \u2014 we won\u2019t know if the year is really good for years.\u201d", "headline": "\u2018Disgusting to Say, but It\u2019s the Truth\u2019: German Winemakers See Boon in Climate Change", "blurb": "Harvesting in the Mosel region of Germany in September.

The prince told police officers he had been \u201cdazzled by the sun,\u201d a witness said.\nStill, some Britons were confused over why the prince, the wizened and gaffe-prone Duke of Edinburgh who is the husband of Queen Elizabeth II, was even driving.\n\u201cYou\u2019d have to be a superhero for your mental acuity not to have slowed down,\u201d said Inger Wallis, a Bloomsbury resident out walking her dog on Friday.\nShe shook her head as she repeated his age, while acknowledging her \u201cdeep respect\u201d for the supporting role he has played for so many decades beside Elizabeth. Ms. Wallis\u2019s own father, she said, hung up the keys at 84, scared to drive.\nIf nothing else, Britons could be thankful that, for one day at least, the agony of Britain\u2019s tortured withdrawal from the European Union was not the leading topic of discussion.\nThe crash, involving a famously headstrong and famously old royal, did provoke a lively discussion about whether Britain should stop older people from driving. The country will have a million drivers older than 85 by 2025, doubled from a few years ago. And those drivers are more vulnerable to crash injuries because of their frailty.\nThat Prince Philip was unaccompanied in the Land Rover by his round-the-clock bodyguards or royal chauffeurs also drew attention to an inconvenient fact, for those who have ever tried to pry the keys from older relatives.\nImage\nThe Obamas and Queen Elizabeth II arriving at the Sovereign\u2019s Entrance in the Quadrangle of Windsor Castle driven by Prince Philip, in 2016.\nCredit\nPool photo by Geoff Pugh\nDriving is a lifeline for some older people, especially in Britain, where smaller towns and rural areas have scant public transit. And older drivers are, by many measures, safer drivers, with people older than 70 half as likely as drivers 25 and younger to kill a pedestrian, the Older Drivers Task Force in Britain said in 2016.\n[When is it time to stop driving? For families everywhere, an all-too-familiar question.]\nIf the government is to take anyone\u2019s keys, experts said, it should target young men.\nArthur Currie, 70, a resident at the Royal Hospital Chelsea for veterans of the British Army, said his relatives sit more stiffly in the passenger seat when he gets behind the wheel. \u201cOr they will say to me, \u2018You see that car coming, Daddy?\u2019\u201d he said. But when they broach the topic of him giving up his keys altogether, Mr. Currie makes his view clear.\n\u201cMy first reaction is looking at them and giving them what they call a laser stare,\u201d he said. \u201cBeing an ex-regimental sergeant major, I have perfected the laser stare.\u201d\nMr. Currie said his only thought, upon hearing about the crash, was concern for Prince Philip and the others involved. As an honorary colonel of the Queen\u2019s Royal Irish Hussars, where Mr. Currie was once a sergeant major, the prince made annual visits to the troops.\n\u201cIf he felt he was able enough to drive, who am I or who\u2019s anybody else to say he shouldn\u2019t be driving?\u201d Mr. Currie said.\nNot all Britons were so deferential.\nJohn Clegg, manning the register at the London Review Bookshop, wondered why the prince could not simply get his driving fix on the private roads of his vast royal estates.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the point in going around in a Land Rover unless you\u2019re going to go off road?\u201d he asked. (Not the most pressing question, perhaps, regarding the solo driving by a 97-year-old royal.)\nMr. Clegg said his grandmother finally persuaded his grandfather to stop driving after too many instances of having to shake him awake.\n\u201cHe never went off the road, but she could see when it could happen,\u201d Mr. Clegg said.\nThe prince is regarded a bit warily by the British public. He is known to be hardheaded and occasionally gruff, and to make racist and sexist comments, including ones about Chinese with \u201cslitty\u201d eyes and women who cannot cook.\nIngrid Seward, a royals expert whose latest book is \u201cMy Husband and I: The Inside Story of 70 Years of the Royal Marriage,\u201d suspected the prince would stubbornly resist the queen\u2019s admonitions about his driving, but would see the logic and could be persuaded to give it up.\nImage\nQueen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip last year. The Duke of Edinburgh is widely known as stubborn, occasionally gruff and gaffe prone.\nCredit\nAlastair Grant/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images\n\u201cIt is the lobotomy of his last vestige of independence,\u201d Ms. Seward said.\nLike many others, Ms. Seward has her own experience trying, with some difficulty, to persuade a parent to relinquish the keys. At 86, her mother took a driving test in an attempt to defy Ms. Seward and prove she could still drive. She failed.\nMs. Seward said Prince Philip may have been alone in the Land Rover because he was only driving from one side of his Sandringham Estate to another. A few years ago, the Obamas got into the car with Prince Philip on the same estate, and looked somewhat less than at ease.\nPrince Philip was known to prize fast sports cars, and the British news media quickly dug up examples of his reckless driving, including one accident in 1996 in which he rear-ended a car at a pedestrian crossing, leaving the driver in a neck brace. As far back as the 1950s, a British tabloid questioned whether he should be trusted to drive the queen around.\nOn Thursday afternoon, he was pulling off a private road and either onto or across a public motorway known for accidents, with its 60 mile-per-hour speed limit and scary bends. Local lawmakers, who coincidentally met on Friday to discuss the road\u2019s safety, lowered the speed to 50 m.p.h.\nAs the British tabloids chronicled in graphic cartoon mock-ups of the crash site, the prince\u2019s car turned over, he was rescued through the sunroof, and had to submit to a breathalyzer test.\nHugh Bladon, 77, a spokesman for the Alliance of British Drivers and a proud older driver, said another alliance member familiar with the road had told him he could understand how the sun may have blinded the prince.\n\u201cObviously, everyone\u2019s going to jump on the age bandwagon,\u201d he said. \u201cBut age actually is nothing to do with skill.\u201d\nBritish law requires drivers at age 70 to start self-reporting medical issues related to their fitness for the road every three years. The Older Drivers Task Force recommended the government raise the age to 75, but also start requiring an eyesight test, a more accurate barometer of any problems.\nBritain instituted driving tests only in 1935, but it is unclear if Prince Philip, who joined the Royal Navy at 18, took one. The royal palace, though, confirmed on Friday that he had a license. The queen, on the other hand, as the person in whose name British licenses are issued, is the only Briton who can drive without one.\nBritish lawyers said there was a chance Prince Philip could be charged with driving without due care and attention, though he could also possibly avoid charges by voluntarily surrendering his license.\nThere were hints on Friday, though, that the prince would not give up quite so easily.

None of them made it, as men screamed in their faces and hurled coconuts.\nVideo of Ms. Ammini\u2019s journey on Jan. 2 shows two women in long black gowns striding through a gilded archway. They maneuver past mostly placid men. \u201cOur visit has been very smooth,\u201d Ms. Ammini, 40, says to the camera.\nA few hours later, the rest of India woke up. Pandemonium followed.\nProtesters in the state of Kerala, where the shrine is, threw crude bombs at the police. Over 3,000 people were arrested. At least one person was killed. Dozens more were injured.\nImage\nBindu Ammini and Kanakadurga being escorted by the police after an unsuccessful attempt to enter the temple in December.\nCredit\nReuters\nWithin hours of the women\u2019s trip, a priest had shut down the Sabarimala Temple to sprinkle water for a \u201cpurification ritual,\u201d evidence to some that the ban was rooted in a belief that menstruating women were dirty.\nFor days, Ms. Ammini has been on the move: bouncing from one safe house to the next, separated from her husband and daughter and weighing the risks of returning home.\nStill, in an interview near the city of Kochi, she said the trip had been worth it. A lower-caste woman who had grown up in grinding poverty, Ms. Ammini emphasized that her entering the temple should not fall under the category of activism. All she was doing, she said, was exercising a constitutional right to equality.\n\u201cWe were not trying to start trouble,\u201d she said. \u201cOur goal was only to visit the temple. For the next generation of women, this is motivation.\u201d\nEvery year, millions of people wait for hours to climb the 18 gold-plated steps leading to the Sabarimala Temple, one of Hinduism\u2019s holiest shrines. For centuries, however, pilgrims say they have observed a de facto bar against women between the ages of 10 and 50, thinking that to allow menstruating women inside would disturb the temple\u2019s celibate deity, Lord Ayyappa.\nCHINA\nBHUTAN\nPAKISTAN\nNEPAL\nBANGLADESH\nINDIA\nMYANMAR\nKERALA\nKochi\nSRI LANKA\n500 MILES\nBy The New York Times\nThough the historical record suggests that women had sporadically visited the temple for years, Kerala\u2019s High Court made the tradition a law in 1991, which was subsequently overturned by the Supreme Court.\nIn the face of the ensuing protests, Kerala\u2019s governing Communist Party of India offered protection to women who wished to visit the temple. But the police struggled to contain crowds blocking the trail. Rosters of the women who had tried to visit the temple spread on social media. They were marked as \u201cHindu haters,\u201d Maoists, atheists, Muslims and \u201cXtians.\u201d\nMs. Ammini said she was unsurprised; many of the protesters were Hindu nationalists. Fallout from the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling had emboldened far-right groups to promote anti-women \u201cBrahmanical interests,\u201d she said. These were issues she had thought about for most of her life.\nBorn to illiterate parents in Kerala, Ms. Ammini described her childhood as perpetually unstable. Tired of beatings by her husband, Ms. Ammini\u2019s mother fled their small village with her young children, taking menial jobs in hotels and on farms.\nGrowing up, Ms. Ammini was always a bit of a rebel, bending rules that had restricted the lives of so many Indian women. She fell for an upper caste boy. At 17, she joined a feminist group.\nImage\nProtesters scuffling with the police in New Delhi after Ms. Ammini and Ms. Kanakadurga entered the temple.\nCredit\nAdnan Abidi/Reuters\nThe risks of speaking out were underlined during that period. Shortly after a local girl was raped and murdered, Ms. Ammini said she and two other women marched into the office of a senior police official and called for the arrest of the men responsible for the crime.\n\u201cThey were siding with the criminals,\u201d she said.\nInstead, a few days later, the police arrested Ms. Ammini, she said, accusing her of attacking a man and knocking out one of his teeth. After a night locked in the police station, she escaped by jumping from the building\u2019s first floor.\n(Ms. Ammini said she was not convicted in the \u201cfake case.\u201d)\nThe first in her family to attend college, Ms. Ammini gravitated to leftist circles at the University of Calicut and joined the Communist Party of India. She also met her future husband, K.V. Hariharan, a party member, bonding with him over books by Pablo Neruda and humanist writers.\n\u201cEven his love letters were serious,\u201d Ms. Ammini said.\nWith little money, Ms. Ammini wore a $2 sari to her wedding in a building called \u201cFreedom Fighters Hall.\u201d A few years later, she gave birth to a daughter, B.H. Olga, naming her for Olga Ben\u00e1rio Prestes, a German Communist who was killed in a Nazi gas chamber.\nIn her 20s and early 30s, Ms. Ammini earned a law degree and climbed up the ranks of the Communist Party of India, weathering splits and realignments. She was often one of the few women at meetings, an observation that pressed on her. Fed up with the direction of the party, she left politics eight years ago and settled into a position teaching law at Kannur University in Kerala.\nImage\nEvery year, millions of people wait for hours to climb the 18 gold-plated steps leading to the Sabarimala Temple, one of Hinduism\u2019s holiest shrines.\nCredit\nArun Sankar/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images\nThen news of the Supreme Court\u2019s verdict captured her attention.\nIn December, Ms. Ammini joined a Facebook group for women who were interested in visiting the temple. She connected with Kanakadurga, 39, a government employee who came from a Hindu family that had opposed the Supreme Court\u2019s verdict. The women teamed up. Some 4,000 women had registered similar intentions with the police.\nOn Dec. 24, they made a first attempt to reach the temple, but retreated after a mob attacked police officers who were escorting the women. Officials encouraged them to forget it and return home, but Ms. Ammini refused.\n\u201cI decided I would start a hunger strike,\u201d she said. The police backed off.\nOn Jan. 1, inspired by news that several million women had joined hands across Kerala to form a \u201cwomen\u2019s wall\u201d for equality, they decided to try again, recruiting a few police officers to accompany them.\nAt 1:26 a.m. Ms. Ammini and Ms. Kanakadurga, who uses one name, started the climb toward the temple. Near the mouth of the complex, the women beelined for an entrance for V.I.P.s, seeing that the main door was too clogged with people.\nBut inside, nobody confronted the women, Ms. Ammini said. A pilgrim offered her water. They capped off a short visit by praying to the deity. \u201cThe violent mob was out of that place,\u201d she said. \u201cNo devotee raised any voice against our journey to the shrine.\u201d\nImage\nMs. Ammini and Kanakadurga.\nCredit\nSamyukta Lakshmi for The New York Times\nOn the way down, Ms. Ammini said she stopped cooperating with the police, who tried to keep her head covered with a shawl. The women lingered at stalls to buy rice and lemon juice.\n\u201cSome of the media said that the police used us,\u201d she said. \u201cThe fact is that the police were always the ones who were afraid.\u201d\nIn the days after the visit, other women tried unsuccessfully to visit the shrine. This week, two women in men\u2019s clothing were turned back. Another woman angrily claimed that she was prevented from going to the temple even after telling the police that she had no uterus. Ms. Ammini burst out laughing when she heard this.\n\u201cWe definitely have uteruses,\u201d she said.\nNew challenges await the women. The Supreme Court plans to consider review petitions, though lawyers do not expect a reversal of the verdict. This week, after the women left a safe house, Ms. Kanakadurga\u2019s mother-in-law beat her so badly with a piece of wood, she said, that she was hospitalized.\nMs. Ammini said she was realistic about her safety, fretting about a recent ominous \u201csilence\u201d in Kerala. But the way forward \u2014 \u201cto serve the society, work with Dalits, women, for blacks\u201d \u2014 had never been plainer or more urgent, she said.\n\u201cThey may attack me, they may kill me, but I feel no fear,\u201d she said. \u201cI am struggling for existence.\u201d", "headline": "The Saturday Profile: Her Visit to a Men-Only Temple Went Smoothly.

He vowed to \u201csave the country\u201d from what he has described as Mr. Ghani\u2019s mismanagement.\nHe joins a list of former officials who have either formally joined the race or declared that they will do so. They include Rahmatullah Nabil, a onetime intelligence chief who has selected an army general and a female former cabinet minister as his running mates (Afghanistan has two vice presidents); Zalmai Rassoul, a 75-year-old former foreign minister, who came a distant third in the disputed 2014 race that brought Mr. Ghani to power; and Shaida Abdali, a former diplomat seen as close to former President Hamid Karzai.\nMr. Ghani, who has declared that he will seek a second term, is scheduled to begin his re-election bid on Sunday. A senior official close to him said Mr. Ghani had dismissed his controversial first vice president, Gen. Abdul Rashid Dostum, from the ticket, with Amrullah Saleh, a former intelligence chief that he recently tapped to lead the country\u2019s police force, replacing him.\nGeneral Dostum is accused of abducting, torturing and sexually assaulting a rival in 2016, the latest in a long history of human rights violations he is alleged to have carried out. The general is likely to support Mr. Ghani behind the scenes while putting forward a confidant, Suraya Dalil, to represent his party in a senior role in the government, the official said.\nThe emergence of powerful candidates reduces the uncertainty over whether the presidential elections, which were delayed after originally having been scheduled for the spring, would happen at all.\nA concerted push by American diplomats to begin negotiations with the Taliban had raised the possibility that the election might be delayed further, or even replaced with an effort to reach a peace settlement that could pave the way for the Taliban\u2019s participation in the government.\nThere was strong pushback against such rumors from the government and Afghanistan\u2019s political parties. And the American-led efforts to persuade the Taliban to sit down with the Afghan government for talks seem to have hit major roadblocks, despite repeated meetings between American diplomats and the insurgents in recent months.\nThe Taliban say they will not meet with Afghan negotiators until they have an agreement with the United States over the future of American troops in the country and the release of insurgent prisoners, among other issues.\nThe July election faces several challenges, chief among them security, with the Taliban threatening large parts of the country. There are also fears that fraud will undermine the voting, as it has so often.\nA parliamentary election in October was tainted by widespread accusations of rigging and mismanagement. Nearly three months later, the results are still not final.\nMohammad Yousef Rashid, who leads the independent Free and Fair Election Forum of Afghanistan, said that the Afghan election commission had struggled to regain the people\u2019s trust after repeated chaotic elections, and that serious reforms were needed before July to avoid a crisis.\n\u201cThese current commissioners are not able to lead the elections and we are aware of their weakness,\u201d Mr. Rashid said. \u201cSecondly, it is about corruption and fraud. Unfortunately, the parliamentary election was full of fraud. If we don\u2019t solve these issues, once again the presidential election will be like a business.\u201d\nThe tickets shaping up for the July race reflect how quickly alliances shift in Afghan politics.\nMr. Atmar got his start as a young intelligence officer in the final days of the Soviet-backed government in the late 1980s, before making his name after the American invasion in 2001 as a respected manager who led several ministries. As his running mates, Mr. Atmar chose two former mujahedeen fighters who joined the guerrilla war against the Soviet-supported government he served, and who also became allies of the Americans after 2001.\nBoth Mr. Atmar and one of his running mates, Mohammed Yonus Qanooni, lost a leg in the last stages of the war against the Soviet Union or soon afterward, when they were on opposing sides.\nMr. Ghani\u2019s ticket also includes former rivals.

This is Catherine Porter, filling in for Ian Austen. Like many Canadians, I have China on my mind this week.\nImage\nChinese President Xi Jinping (right) with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. A diplomatic rift between China and Canada has continued to deepen after Robert Schellenberg, a Canadian citizen, was sentenced to death this week for drug trafficking.\nCredit\nLintao Zhang/Getty Images\nA little more than a year ago, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was traveling to Beijing, hoping for a free trade deal. How things have changed. Since Canada carried out an American warrant and arrested Huawei's chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, in the Vancouver airport last month, Canada seems to have become enemy No. 1 of the Chinese government. The price has been steep for three Canadians in particular: Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, both detained in China and accused of threatening national security, as well as Robert Schellenberg, who was hastily retried this week for drug smuggling. His original sentence of 15 years in prison was replaced with the death penalty.\n[Want the Canada Letter in your inbox every week? Sign up here.]\nIn Canada, the sentence has been viewed as a kind of international ransom. But I wondered how the d\u00e9tente has been perceived in China. I reached out to my colleague Chris Buckley. An Australian by birth, Chris has lived in China for more than two decades and studied Chinese Communist Party history at Renmin University in Beijing. He joined The Times in 2012.\nWhat is public opinion of Canada like in China now?\nIt\u2019s not simple. When I walk home from work at night, I pass close by the newly opened Canada Goose store in Beijing, and there have been long lines of people waiting to go in. On the other hand, I think that most Chinese people accept their government\u2019s view that Huawei is being victimized in the West and that Meng Wanzhou was unfairly arrested in Canada.\nHow has the Schellenberg case been reported in Chinese media?\nIt\u2019s been getting attention here in China, too, though not on the same level as it has received in Canada. The cases of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor were reported in the Chinese media, mostly accounts of their arrests and the Chinese foreign ministry\u2019s pushback against criticism. Robert Schellenberg\u2019s appeal hearing and detention attracted more media attention, using the court\u2019s account of the trial. Throughout all this, the Global Times, which is a brashly nationalist newspaper and website, has led the way in criticizing the Canadian government.\nImage\nRobert Lloyd Schellenberg was retried on drug trafficking charges in China this week and was sentenced to death.\nCredit\nIntermediate Peoples\u2019 Court of Dalian\nReporters were invited to observe the trial. Why would China do that?\nIt\u2019s very unusual for foreign reporters to be allowed in to watch criminal trials. I\u2019ve never been inside a Chinese criminal trial. The court hasn\u2019t said exactly why it made an exception in Mr. Schellenberg\u2019s case. But I suspect two reasons. First, the court and government wanted to show that he received what counts for a proper hearing in China. Second, if Mr. Schellenberg is being used as a bargaining chip, it makes sense for the Chinese government to publicize the trial.\nHow unusual is it in China for a pending execution to be publicized?\nIn heinous murders and crimes like that, the government often publicizes executions. In a case like this \u2014 a drug smuggling case involving a foreigner \u2014 it is much less common. This might be the Chinese government sending a warning to potential drug traffickers, or maybe a way of putting pressure on Canada.\nWhat is the feeling among foreigners inside China now?\nForeigners from Western countries, especially Canada, have been a bit spooked by the arrests. There is certainly not a mass exit of Westerners from China. But I think there is a subsection of people who, like Michael Kovrig \u2014 a former diplomat who worked for a policy NGO \u2014 have a government job background and talk to Chinese academics and officials for their work. For them, especially, his arrest seems to have been unnerving.\nImage\nMeng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of Huawei, leaving her home in Vancouver last month with a security guard.\nCredit\nJonathan Hayward/The Canadian Press, via Associated Press\nWhere do you see this going?\nMs. Meng\u2019s fight against possible extradition to the United States could take many months, even longer. How long it takes for Mr. Schellenberg to work through his appeal and other means for seeking clemency depends very much on how slow or fast the Chinese government wants to go. So for Mr. Schellenberg this could be a long, agonizing wait. Meanwhile, Mr. Kovrig and Mr. Spavor remain in detention and haven\u2019t even been formally charged with specific crimes. So I think this story will be in the news for many months to come, and maybe longer.\n___\nThis week\u2019s Trans Canada and Around The Times highlights were compiled by Lindsey Wiebe, the Canada audience growth editor.\nTrans Canada\n\u2014Robert Lloyd Schellenberg plans to appeal after being sentenced to death for drug smuggling this week in China, amid a deepening diplomatic rift between Canada and China.\n\u2014The 18-year-old who fled Saudi Arabia is ready to experience life as a teenager in Canada.

We had seen and heard the public conversation become more informed, sober and detailed as more people with service in the wars joined it. We were watching with gratitude the emergence of a new generation of writers with wartime experience. We were unsatisfied by the official descriptions of what was happening in Iraq and Afghanistan, and by work from writers who seemed more determined to be in the good graces of the wars\u2019 organizers than in gaining a fuller and more honest grounding in their subject. And we knew, from reading on past conflicts, that much of the best writing about war comes long after combatants have put down their weapons and had time to process and re-examine what they lived. In short, we wanted At War, among its many missions, to be a place for the kinds of discussions we did not hear often enough in the early years after four passenger jets were hijacked on a bluebird morning in 2001.\n[Get a weekly roundup of Times coverage of war delivered to your inbox.

In his case it was the lingering recollection of a \u201c2-year-old child toddling through window glass shattered by an explosive charge and leaving tiny, bloody footprints on the polished concrete floor of his home.\u201d\nMany veterans know something that the Pentagon and the politicians who speak for military action often do not: that regardless of the organizing ideas behind a military campaign, for those who do the fighting, war is often reduced to who is near and whatever happens.

Times journalist and Marine Corps infantry veteran C. J. Chivers, winner of the Pulitzer Prize for his 2016 story about an Afghan war veteran suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, will moderate the discussion. The panelists are Alissa J. Rubin, the Times Paris bureau chief who won a Pulitzer Prize for foreign reporting on Afghanistan in 2015; Azmat Khan, an investigative reporter and New York Times Magazine contributor, who uncovered civilian casualties among nearly 150 airstrike sites across northern Iraq; and writer Brian Castner, a veteran of the Iraq war and weapons expert for Amnesty International\u2019s crisis team, who also investigates war crimes and human rights violations.\nGet tickets here.\nThe Latest Stories From At War\nAfghan War Casualty Report: Jan. 11-17\nAt least 62 pro-government forces and three civilians were killed in Afghanistan during the past week.\nJan. 18, 2019\nRead the Afghan War Casualty Report from previous weeks \u00bb\nEditor\u2019s Picks\nThe Hunt for the Nazi Loot Still Sitting on Library Shelves: The art stolen by the Nazis has gotten more attention, but millions of books were also looted from Jews, and others, and have yet to be returned.\n\u2018The Taliban Made Me Fight\u2019: What to Do With Child Recruits After They Serve Time?: Afghan children as young as 8 have been imprisoned after being caught preparing suicide attacks.

It emphasized Germany\u2019s appreciation that it had been welcomed back as a sovereign nation after the conflict and as a European power.\n\u201cThis we, as Germans, have not forgotten and we are grateful,\u201d the letter went on, concluding that \u201cBritons should know: From the bottom of our hearts, we want them to stay.\u201d\nNorbert R\u00f6ttgen, head of the German Parliament\u2019s Committee on Foreign Affairs, who co-wrote the letter, said the signers decided they needed to say something after this week\u2019s defeat of the British prime minister\u2019s Brexit proposal.\n\u201cThe time was ripe to make sure that we raise our voice, and that we try to make it a German voice, to let the Brits know that while we fully respect what they decide, we do consider it a European affair,\u201d Mr. R\u00f6ttgen said. \u201cWe wanted to say what we feel, to express our convictions and our deep emotions.\u201d\n[Read about an unlikely Brexit star, and villain: the speaker of the British House of Commons.]\nThe intervention comes at a critical moment in Britain following the crushing rejection on Tuesday of Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s plan for withdrawal from the European Union, or Brexit. There is growing speculation that the deadlock could lead to a general election or a second referendum that might reverse the whole idea.\nIt is unclear whether a lovebomb from figures as varied as the Airbus chief, Thomas Enders, and the punk rock singer Campino will have much impact. But at least one signatory to the letter commands some name recognition in Britain: Jens Lehmann, the former goalkeeper of Germany\u2019s national soccer team.\nBehind the initiative lies concern in Berlin over the prospect that Britain may leave the European Union without an agreement, with economically damaging consequences for the entire continent.\nWhile the European Union \u2014 and especially France \u2014 took a tough line in negotiating the withdrawal, Britain and Germany have often agreed on economic issues in Brussels. But Brexit is destined to change the internal balance within the European Union, removing a country that has often been useful to Berlin politically and a big financial contributor to the bloc.\nBritons\u2019 reaction to the letter was mixed, with some commenting on its folksy focus on the country\u2019s \u201clegendary black humor,\u201d drinking tea with milk, Christmas pantomime and driving on the left.\nImage\nAnnegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, the favorite to become Germany\u2019s next chancellor, was among the figures describing their admiration for many things British in a letter published Friday.\nCredit\nFocke Strangmann/EPA, via Shutterstock\nAs enemies in two world wars in the 20th century, the two countries have a complicated relationship. Germany\u2019s affection for Britain is not always reciprocated, despite widespread respect for the German postwar economic miracle and its modern-day success.\nSporting rivalry is particularly fierce in soccer, where the record has at times been so grim for England that Gary Lineker, the TV host and former England international player, once described it as a game where \u201c22 men chase a ball for 90 minutes and at the end, the Germans always win.\u201d\nWhether the intervention will help or hinder the pro-Europeans in Britain\u2019s Brexit debate is a moot point, as the British are prickly about anything that could be construed as outside interference in political discussions.\nSpeaking to reporters in London, Tony Blair, the former prime minister, welcomed the letter, saying it redressed the impression that Brexit negotiations were frequently confrontational.\n\u201cA clear statement acknowledging what is clearly true \u2014 that it\u2019s better for Europe as well as for Britain that we change Brexit \u2014 is important,\u201d said Mr. Blair, who is arguing for a second Brexit referendum.\nHe added that he believed the initiative had come about because, with Parliament deadlocked, there was an increased possibility of a second referendum. However, he added, \u201cIf we do decide that we want to think again, I think it\u2019s important that Europe indicates that its politics has changed in the last 30 months and that means particularly addressing the question of immigration.\u201d\nThose on the other side of the debate, of course, took the opposite view. One Brexit hard-liner in Parliament, John Redwood, wrote on Twitter that members of the German establishment had shown \u201ctheir scorn for democracy,\u201d were taking the British \u201cfor fools\u201d and wanted to keep Britain in the European Union only because of its annual budget payments.\nMr. R\u00f6ttgen dismissed such criticism as entirely predictable: \u201cThat this letter would be used and abused by those who are so desperate to leave, under any circumstance, that they reject the idea of reconsidering anything, this was quite clear.\u201d\nThough the letter sounded genuine and sincere, some Germans believe Britain has become such an awkward partner in the European Union that it is better outside the bloc.\nWhen Andrea Nahles, one signer of the letter, wrote on Twitter this week of her regret at the implications of the defeat of Mrs. May\u2019s plan, the response was mixed, and much less sentimental than the letter published on Friday.\nA British TV news anchor, Matt Frei, suggested that the authentic view of Brexit in Germany might be a little less diplomatic. On Twitter he described a conversation in Berlin that drew a parallel to Prince Philip\u2019s car accident this week.\n\u201cOverheard in a Berlin bakery,\u201d he wrote, \u201cBrexit is like a 97 year old royal behind the wheel.

Since the signing of the peace accords, the Colombian government has said it turned the page on that violent era.\nVideo\nA car bomb exploded in front of a police academy in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia, killing at least 10 people.

The camera also captured images of a human foot and what appeared to be a severed head.\nRescue workers struggled to carry possible survivors out on stretchers.\nThe attack against security forces in Colombia\u2019s center of power was an escalation of hostilities with the ELN, which in the past year has bombed police stations, attacked oil pipelines and kidnapped soldiers, policemen and military contractors.\nIn a speech on Friday night, President Iv\u00e1n Duque of Colombia announced that Colombian authorities had reactivated arrest warrants for members of the ELN leadership and had asked Cuba, where 10 members are based, to extradite them.\n\u201cThe ELN is and has been a criminal machine of kidnappings and attacks,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have had enough of death.\u201d\nEven before the attack, Mr. Duque, whose right-wing Democratic Center party campaigned against the peace deal with the FARC, expressed little enthusiasm for negotiating with the ELN.\nImage\nA vigil outside the police academy.

He lost a hand at one point in an explosion and thereafter was known by the nickname \u201cMocho,\u201d slang in Colombia for someone who is missing a hand or arm.\nIn 2015, as the FARC was nearing its peace deal with the government, Mr. Rojas had tried three times to pass himself off as a member of that group to receive demobilization benefits, but FARC members rejected him repeatedly, said Mr. Botero, the defense minister.\nThe FARC, which has given up arms and formed a political party, worked to distance itself from the attack this week.\n\u201cWe express our solidarity with the victims and their families,\u201d the party wrote in a statement after the attack. \u201cAnd we call on all sectors of the country to keep building a pact that takes violence and weapons out of doing politics.\u201d\nImage\nThe suspect in the car bombing attack, Jos\u00e9 Aldemar Rojas Rodr\u00edguez, was part of a Marxist rebel group known as the ELN.\nCredit\nAttorney General'S Office, via European Pressphoto Agency\nBut the ELN has taken a different stance from their former guerrilla brethren.\nLast January, a faction of the group claimed responsibility for an attack that killed five police officers and wounded 40 others in a Colombian port city. During the summer, they tried to coax the government into negotiations by offering nine hostages for ransom. The kidnappings continued even this month, when the group said it had downed a civilian helicopter and taken three more hostages.\nJeremy McDermott, the co-founder of Insight Crime, a foundation that tracks criminal groups, said the group\u2019s fractured command structure meant that some factions kept fighting the government even while others may express interest in a peace deal.\n\u201cThe ELN isn\u2019t a vertically integrated organization,\u201d he said.\nHis foundation is also tracking another problem for the government: Former rebels of the FARC who have taken up arms once again. Last fall, Insight Crime estimated that as many as 2,800 fighters may have returned to arms \u2014 about 40 percent of the number that fought before the peace deal.\nJairo Libreros, a professor at Externado University in Bogot\u00e1 who also works as a security analyst, said he saw little option for the government other than to continue fighting guerrilla groups like the rogue FARC fighters and ELN.\n\u201cThe ELN is still anchored in ideologies from the last century,\u201d he said, referring to its vows to continue Marxist struggle. \u201cBut this attack closes any window there was for negotiation in the short term.\u201d", "headline": "Colombia Car Bombing Suspect Belonged to Rebel Group, Government Says", "blurb": "Police cars and a firetruck outside a police academy in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia, on Friday, a day after a car bomb attack killed 21 people there.", "referenced_places": [{"name": "Colombia", "lat": 2.8894434, "lon": -73.783892}, {"name": "Cuba", "lat": 23.0131338, "lon": -80.8328748}]}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/18/world/australia/wombat-selfie.html?partner=rss&emc=rss": {"content": "LONDON \u2014 Don\u2019t pester the wombats.\nThat is the plea from Australian tourism officials dealing with hordes of visitors to an island and nature preserve who cannot resist the urge to follow the marsupials around, approach them for selfies or even cuddle them.\nWombats roam free on Maria Island, where there are no natural predators and no permanent human inhabitants. Along with other wildlife, they have taken over the island, a former prison colony with a small ghost town and vast green expanses, just off the coast of Tasmania, south of the Australian mainland.\nLooking like big teddy bears, the stocky, furry animals \u2014 each about three feet long and weighing 50 to 70 pounds \u2014 have no fear of people, and amble up to visitors as soon as they get off the ferry. But officials this month have called on people to fight the urge to get too close and to respect the habitat they are visiting.\n\u201cThe tourists are in love with the wombats; so in love that we need to give them some education about how to interact with them,\u201d Ruth Dowdy, the head of the tourism board on Tasmania\u2019s East Coast, told ABC Radio Hobart.\nThe wombats do not react much when visitors pose right beside them for memorable selfies, push cameras right up to their noses, take up-close video as they eat or just follow them around.\n\u201cThey pretty much ignore people, but people run up to them and they don\u2019t run away,\u201d Ms. Dowdy said.\nThough the animals are usually calm about the attention, they can be bothered by it. Wombats are herbivores, but they have powerful jaws and big claws for burrowing, and have been known to bite and scratch people who startle them or approach their young.\nLocal businesses and Tasmania\u2019s Parks and Wildlife service have come up with a pledge, posted at the ferry to the island and online.\nOne part of the pledge reads:\nWombats, when you trundle past me I pledge I will not chase you with my selfie stick, or get too close to your babies. I will not surround you, or try and pick you up. I will make sure I don\u2019t leave rubbish or food from my morning tea. I pledge to let you stay wild.\nMaria Island is just one example of a phenomenon known as overtourism, accelerated by technology. It clogs celebrated towns with pedestrian traffic and prompts questions about whether the love of art has been overtaken by the love of documenting the experience of viewing art.\nHumans seeking the perfect selfie have even been known to imperil their own lives \u2014 a phenomenon named the \u201ckillfie.\u201d\nBut people interfering with animals, failing to understand that wild creatures really are wild, is a growing problem, too.\nSometimes it stems from misplaced compassion, like in the spring of 2016, when visitors at Yellowstone National Park, who thought a baby bison was cold, took the calf into their car and drove it to a ranger station. Later, rejected by its own herd, the calf was euthanized.\nOften, recklessness is to blame. Last year a woman in Transylvania was injured when she tried to take a selfie with a bear.\nThe trend has prompted officials around the world to look for ways to keep wildlife and visitors safe from each other. In the United States, the National Park Service, for example, invites visitors to take the \u201cYellowstone Pledge,\u201d available in 10 languages.\n\u201cPractice safe selfies by never approaching animals to take a picture,\u201d is the top point in the pledge.\nAnd animal protection organizations have called on Instagram to crack down on \u201cbad selfies,\u201d those that involve hugging and holding wildlife. The social network has posted warnings on popular hashtags, like those used by people taking selfies with quokkas, another kind of marsupial, in Australia last year.\nBut as some selfies themselves show, Australia also abounds with opportunities to interact with wombats and others in zoos and parks, where professionals can keep an eye on their welfare.", "headline": "Give the Wombats Some Space, Australia Tells Selfie-Loving Tourists", "blurb": "Furry marsupials with no fear of humans, wombats often walk right up to visitors to Australia\u2019s Maria Island.", "lat": 51.5073219, "lon": -0.1276474, "location_string": "London", "referenced_places": [{"name": "United States", "lat": 39.7837304, "lon": -100.4458825}, {"name": "Australia", "lat": -24.7761086, "lon": 134.755}]}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/18/world/australia/melbourne-aiia-maasarwe-killing.html?partner=rss&emc=rss": {"content": "MELBOURNE, Australia \u2014 The authorities in Australia have charged a 20-year-old man with the rape and murder of Aiia Maasarwe, an Israeli exchange student who was attacked on a Melbourne street this week.\nThe man, Codey Herrmann, of the Melbourne suburb of Greensborough, was arrested on Friday afternoon and was charged in the Melbourne Magistrates\u2019 Court on Saturday.

It refers to a Segovia myth that the Devil, not the Romans, had given the city its famous aqueduct, which towers 90 feet over the Old Town of Segovia.\nAccording to the legend, the Devil offered a deal to a young girl who was tired of dragging water through the city\u2019s steep streets: He would get the water to her home before dawn, in return for her soul. As the Devil labored all night to build the aqueduct, she prayed. A storm came, holding up the Devil\u2019s work, and in the end, he lost his bid by one stone.\nMs. Lazaro said the statue was a departure from the true message of the legend: to \u201ctake care of one\u2019s soul and repent.\u201d\nIn recent years, Spain has seen similar high-profile court cases led by the Spanish Association of Christian Lawyers. The association has mostly used an article in the Spanish criminal code that forbids \u201coffending the feelings of members of a religious confession.\u201d\nIn 2014, the association tried to remove the director of the Reina Sofia art museum in Madrid for displaying artwork that alluded to burning churches. In 2017, it filed a complaint against a drag queen who performed as the Virgin Mary and Jesus on the cross. And the actor and theater producer Willy Toledo was briefly detained by the police last year after he ignored a court summons for publishing insults about God and the Virgin Mary online. He is still awaiting trial.\nOther cases have targeted political art. Last year, a work labeling Catalonia\u2019s separatist leaders as political prisoners was removed from an international art fair.\nSegovia, popular with tourists, had largely avoided such controversy \u2014 until the Devil appeared. Mr. Abella, a retired doctor who works as a novelist and occasional sculptor, had offered his statue to the city free. The idea for it came from a conversation with city officials in which Mr. Abella recalled the smiling Devil he had seen years ago in the German city of L\u00fcbeck.\nOn Thursday, a judge rejected the injunction request against the statue and ordered the Christian association to pay 500 euros, or about $570, in legal fees, according to a court email on Friday.\nEven if there is further opposition, the short, jovial Devil is likely to take up residence in the city next week, Claudia De Santos, who leads the city\u2019s heritage and tourism department, said by phone on Friday.\nMs. de Santos told El Pa\u00eds that the Catholic association had claimed that Segovia would become a focal point for satanic worship.\n\u201cI just can\u2019t believe that this could happen in 21st-century Spain,\u201d she said.", "headline": "Statue of a Friendly, Selfie-Taking Devil Divides a Town", "blurb": "A Catholic association said that installing the statue in Segovia, Spain, would be \u201cglorifying evil.\u201d The artist says his work has nothing to do with religion.", "referenced_places": [{"name": "Spain", "lat": 39.3262345, "lon": -4.8380649}]}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/18/business/carlos-ghosn-mitsubishi.html?partner=rss&emc=rss": {"content": "TOKYO \u2014 Mitsubishi Motors has joined Nissan in accusing Carlos Ghosn of financial wrongdoing, saying on Friday that he secretly received compensation of 7.8 million euros, or almost $9 million, from a joint venture of the two automakers.\nOsamu Masuko, Mitsubishi\u2019s chief executive, told reporters in Tokyo that the automaker was considering suing Mr. Ghosn, the former chairman of both Nissan and Mitsubishi. Renault, the third automaker in the global car alliance that Mr. Ghosn ran, is also preparing to cut ties with its star executive.\nMr. Ghosn has been detained in Tokyo since Nov. 19 on suspicion of understating his salary for eight years, and of temporarily transferring personal investment losses to Nissan\u2019s books during the 2008 financial crisis. Mr. Ghosn has denied all charges. His lawyers could not immediately be reached for comment.\nMitsubishi\u2019s findings involve a joint venture between Nissan and Mitsubishi established in 2017 in the Netherlands. The company said Mr. Ghosn, who is listed as a director of the joint venture, had drawn up an employment contract that rewarded him \u20ac7.8 million in compensation.\nThe joint venture had been set up to distribute part of the savings generated by Nissan\u2019s 2017 acquisition of Mitsubishi to the departments at the automakers that generated the savings, a kind of incentive scheme to bring the companies closer together.\nThe joint venture\u2019s other directors \u2014 Mr. Masuko and Nissan\u2019s chief executive, Hiroto Saikawa \u2014 were unpaid and kept in the dark about Mr. Ghosn\u2019s compensation, according to Mitsubishi.

The joint venture was an unincorporated subsidiary of Mitsubishi and Nissan registered in the Netherlands, meaning it is likely to be beyond the purview of Japanese financial regulators.\nMitsubishi\u2019s allegations are the latest twist in a fall from grace for Mr. Ghosn, an industry titan. Nissan and Mitsubishi have already removed Mr. Ghosn from his posts as chairman at the two companies, though he remains on their boards.\nNissan owns a controlling stake in Mitsubishi Motors, while Renault is Nissan\u2019s biggest shareholder.\nRenault had stood by Mr. Ghosn, keeping him as chairman and chief executive even as he sat in a Tokyo jail. But after a Tokyo court rejected his bail request Tuesday, the French government called for new leadership at the automaker. Its board is expected to meet in the coming days to consider cutting ties with him.\nTwo French officials, including the government\u2019s representative on the Renault board, were in Tokyo for meetings this week, though Nissan has declined to comment on any discussions.\nNaming a successor to Mr. Ghosn would not necessarily mean Renault considered him guilty of wrongdoing. It could instead reflect a realistic assessment of the executive\u2019s inability to perform his duties from jail, where he has limited contact with the outside world.\nMitsubishi, meanwhile, will \u201cpush forward with its investigation,\u201d Mr. Masuko said.", "headline": "Mitsubishi Accuses Carlos Ghosn of Taking a Secret $9 Million Payment", "blurb": "Osamu Masuko, Mitsubishi\u2019s chief executive, left, said that the automaker was considering suing Mr. Ghosn, its former chairman.", "lat": 35.6828387, "lon": 139.7594549, "location_string": "Tokyo", "referenced_places": [{"name": "Netherlands", "lat": 52.2379891, "lon": 5.53460738161551}]}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/18/magazine/afghan-war-casualty-report.html?partner=rss&emc=rss": {"content": "The following report compiles all significant security incidents confirmed by New York Times reporters throughout Afghanistan from the past seven days.

Both of the major, multiparty political alliances fell well short of an outright majority in the Parliament in the September elections, and forming a government 133 days later required splitting both blocs.\nThe Social Democrats and Green Party will govern without the third member of their campaign bloc, the Left Party. To consent to the government\u2019s formation, the Center Party and the Liberals broke with the other two members of the center-right alliance they had joined in the campaign.\nIn Sweden, a government does not require majority support in Parliament. But a majority vote can prevent its formation, and an attempt to do that on Friday fell short, with 153 of 349 lawmakers voting to block the new government from taking office.\nAs part of the agreement, the Social Democrats and Greens signed onto a 73-point declaration of intent that is heavy on conservative policies like mandatory language testing to become a citizen, lower taxes and weaker employment protection rules. It also ruled out any influence from the Left Party, the heir to the old Communist Party.\nThe Social Democrats\u2019 bloc on the left won 144 of 349 seats in the election, while the conservative alliance led by the Moderate Party won 143. The nationalist, right-wing Sweden Democrats won 62 seats, by far the best result in the party\u2019s history.\nThat could have put the Sweden Democrats in a position to influence the formation of a government and extract concessions, even if it were not part of the governing coalition.\nThe Liberals and Center Party, which support free-market economics and socially liberal policies, sought to prevent that.\n\u201cWe choose to tolerate this government that can act without support from the Sweden Democrats,\u201d said Annie Loof, leader of the Center Party. \u201cIt\u2019s not our first choice.\u201d\nJimmie Akesson of the Sweden Democrats called the new government \u201cstrange, absurd and bizarre.\u201d\nThe political situation in Sweden has not been so complicated in almost a century, said Torbjorn Larsson, a political scientist at Stockholm University.\nImage\n\u201cThe Center Party and the Liberals have been duped,\u201d said Ulf Kristersson, leader of the Moderate Party.\nCredit\nJonathan Nackstrand/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images\n\u201cUntil now there has been very little cooperation between these two blocs,\u201d Mr. Larsson said.

He and Ebba Busch Thor, the leader of the other member of last year\u2019s four-party bloc, the Christian Democrats, declared the alliance dead.\nMs. Busch Thor called the new arrangement \u201can unholy alliance.\u201d\nFormer Prime Minister Carl Bildt, a moderate, wrote on Twitter: \u201cAfter some sort of secret supplementary agreement with the ex-Communists PM L\u00f6fven will be back as PM in Sweden again.

One of them, Carl Schlyter, told the public broadcaster SVT that the left bloc would have been more effective in the opposition than peddling a conservative agenda.\n\u201cPeople who are struggling have very few places to turn in this agreement,\u201d he said.\nDaniel Suhonen, the head of Katalys, a trade union research group, said the mix of free-market policies, weakened worker protections and potentially relaxed migration rules could backfire in favor of the Sweden Democrats.\n\u201cWhat you put at risk here is the Social Democratic Party and its historical role of protecting the working class,\u201d Mr. Suhonen said.\nBut Carl Petter Torvaldsson, head of LO, the Swedish Trade Union Confederation, said that in casting their lots with the Social Democrats rather than the Sweden Democrats, the Center Party and the Liberals had sent a strong signal that Sweden stands up to xenophobic parties.\nPolitical analysts said the election and governing agreement show that Sweden\u2019s politics are becoming more like those across Europe, with greater fragmentation, and fights over issues like migration and cultural identity that cut across old ideological lines.\n\u201cThis stable political situation with either the left or the right ruling in Sweden, that time is gone,\u201d he said.\nGoran von Sydow, head of the Swedish Institute for European Policy Studies, an independent research institute, said: \u201cIn the end it was the only workable solution.

Here\u2019s the latest:\nImage\nPresident Trump at the Pentagon.\nCredit\nDoug Mills/The New York Times\nU.S. plans to expand missile defenses\nPresident Trump announced new investments in missile defenses aimed at shielding the nation from missile attacks, though he did not mention the largest U.S. nuclear adversaries, Russia or China.\n\u201cOur strategy is grounded in one overriding objective: to detect and destroy every type of missile attack against any American target, whether before or after launch,\u201d Mr. Trump said at the Pentagon. In fact, the plans released by the Pentagon are aimed largely at destroying small numbers of missiles launched by regional powers like Iran or North Korea, rather than overwhelming strikes from Russia or China.\nBackground: Antimissile systems are extremely costly \u2014 the U.S. has spent more than $300 billion on them to date \u2014 and also extremely difficult to get right. Intercepting speeding targets in the sky is like hitting a bullet with a bullet, and a system introduced in 2004 has failed in 50 percent of tests.\nTiming: The announcement came a day before Vice President Mike Pence is scheduled to meet with North Korea\u2019s lead nuclear program negotiator, Kim Yong-chol, in Washington. Earlier this week, Mr. Pence said the U.S. was still waiting for \u201cconcrete steps from North Korea\u201d toward denuclearization \u2014 a demand that has so far stalled dialogue between the two countries.\nImage\nThe scene outside Parliament in London on Thursday.\nCredit\nNeil Hall/EPA, via Shutterstock\nBritain awaits Theresa May\u2019s Plan B\nThe prime minister has to return to Parliament by Monday with an updated blueprint for Britain\u2019s withdrawal from the E.U. That plan is to go to a vote on Jan. 29.\nDays after Parliament resoundingly rejected her initial Brexit plan, she invited opposition  politicians to discuss a compromise. But the opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn asked her first to rule out a \u201cno-deal\u201d exit. Mrs. May rejected the demand as an \u201cimpossible condition.\u201d\nView from Brussels: E.U. officials initially saw Britain\u2019s growing political crisis as a victory, discouraging other countries from wanting to leave the bloc and contrasting it with the E.U.\u2019s unity. But now it looks increasingly likely that Britain could leave the bloc without a deal, and the E.U. is starting to worry.\nPerspective: British leaders have come under sharp criticism over Brexit. Their failings, the Op-Ed contributor Pankaj Mishra argues, have parallels in the British Empire\u2019s ruinous departure from India.\nImage\nA bus outside the U.S. Capitol on Thursday with a House delegation whose trip to Afghanistan was postponed by President Trump.\nCredit\nSarah Silbiger/The New York Times\nThe president hits back at Nancy Pelosi\nPresident Trump\u2019s squabbling with Democrats grew more acid as the partial government shutdown continued. After Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker, threatened to cancel his planned State of the Union address, Mr. Trump announced on Thursday that he was postponing an overseas trip she had planned that he called a \u201cpublic relations event,\u201d and Washington more and more came to resemble a sandbox filled with children.\nDetails: In a letter dripping with sarcasm, Mr. Trump denied her and her delegation military transport and suggested they might fly commercial. A spokesman for Ms. Pelosi noted that they were planning to travel to Afghanistan, a war zone, to see U.S. forces, and added that Mr. Trump had visited troops in Iraq during the shutdown.\nShutdown: A makeshift national safety net is spreading slowly and unevenly as the longest shutdown in history staggers toward its one-month mark.\nImage\nPresident Aleksandar Vucic of Serbia, right, welcoming his Russian counterpart, Vladimir V.

Serbia\u2019s president, Aleksandar Vucic, welcomed him by busing in tens of thousands of people for a rally. The two announced a big new gas deal, and many who showed up for the events said they were incentivized, including with five liters of milk.\nContext: Serbia is once again a fulcrum of Balkan volatility, and the visit has been a display of what a researcher calls Putin\u2019s orchestra in the country, powered by a growing number of pro-Russia media outlets and nongovernmental groups. But the acoustics are complicated by the fact that Serbia is seeking to join E.U.\nReaction: Tens of thousands of people have been regularly protesting through the winter against Mr. Vucic\u2019s increasingly Putin-like and authoritarian style, and the country\u2019s opposition leader said he feared the E.U. would further overlook his autocratic tendencies in a bid to counter Russia.\nLooking ahead: To join the E.U., Serbia would have to compromise on Kosovo, which Russia and Serbia refuse to recognize, and which Mr. Putin accused of ratcheting up tensions. Mr. Vucic has floated partitioning Kosovo, a risky proposition that John Bolton, President Trump\u2019s national security adviser, has said he\u2019s open to.\nHere\u2019s what else is happening\nJamal Khashoggi: A new book by three Turkish journalists offers the most comprehensive description of the killing of the Saudi dissident in Istanbul last year, drawing on audio recordings obtained by Turkish intelligence officials.\nHitachi: The company said it was suspending work on a $19.3 billion nuclear power plant in North Wales that had been expected to provide hundreds of new local jobs, after the British and Japanese governments failed to agree on financial terms.\nImage\nA window broken after a bomb car bomb exploded on Thursday at a police academy minutes after a promotion ceremony for officers.\nCredit\nMauricio Duenas Castaneda/EPA, via Shutterstock\nColombia: Ten people were killed and 72 wounded by a bombing at a Bogot\u00e1 police academy  that raised the specter of a return to the country\u2019s violent past and came at a time when President Iv\u00e1n Duque, according to a rights group, has been promoting military officers accused of extrajudicial killings.\nFamily separations: The Trump administration most likely separated thousands more children from their parents at the Southern border than was previously believed, according to a report by government inspectors.\nFacebook: The social media company said it deleted nearly 500 pages and accounts related to two disinformation campaigns originating from Russia that targeted users in Eastern Europe and Central Asia.\nMicrosoft: The company pledged $500 million to help address the affordable housing crisis in Seattle, one of a number of cities where the explosive growth of the technology industry has contributed to widening inequality.\nChina: The country is facing its most precipitous population decline in decades, a trend that could have far-reaching economic and political consequences.\nAustralian Open: Simona Halep, Serena Williams and Novak Djokovic advanced to the third round.

These are people whose family and friends are reading your article and experiencing indelible trauma from seeing their loved ones\u2019 photos,\u201d Lorna Kagecha wrote in an email to The Times. \u201cWe do not see this kind of nonsense when you write articles on attacks in the Western world.\u201d\nWhile many social media users blamed our incoming East Africa bureau chief, Kimiko de Freytas-Tamura, for posting the image, she played no role. As with any article, decisions about photography are made by editors in New York or elsewhere, not by reporters.\nThe publication of graphic images is never taken lightly at The Times. Many people across the newsroom are involved in difficult conversations, weighing the desire to be sensitive and respectful of victims and their families with our mission to give readers a clear view of what\u2019s happening in the world.\nTo provide more insight into the decisions behind publishing graphic photos, Meaghan Looram, our director of photography, and Marc Lacey, our National editor and former foreign correspondent based in Nairobi, have answered questions drawn from reader feedback.\nWe welcome you to continue the conversation in the comments section.\nWhat considerations went into choosing the photos in this article? Why did you decide to run the image of dead bodies?\nMEAGHAN LOORAM Let me first say that editors in New York made the decision on which images to publish with the story. Our reporter did not have any input into this decision.\nOur editors always take into consideration the newsworthiness of the story and our responsibility to our readers to honestly convey the events of the world, horrific and disturbing as those events may sometimes be.\nWe look at the universe of images available from any given event, and we try to make a decision that both serves our readers and respects the dignity of those affected by the attack or event.\nGenerally, we try to avoid identifying victims or showing unnecessary blood and gore, particularly if it is not central to the news story that the photograph accompanies.\nBut it is an important part of our role as journalists to document the impact of violence in the world, and if we avoid publishing these types of images, we contribute to obscuring the effects of violence and making debates over security and terrorism bloodless.\nImage\nA burial ceremony on Wednesday in Nairobi, Kenya, for Feisal Ahmed, who was killed in the attack.\nCredit\nAndrew Renneisen/Getty Images\nWe believe that our coverage contributes to national and global discussions on national security, foreign policy, America\u2019s role in international conflicts, gun violence and terror. If we shy away from showing the real consequences of some of these policies, then we are doing our readers, and even those who make some of these policy decisions, a disservice.\nThis year, some of the most disturbing and moving images we published showed starving children in Yemen, a consequence of a yearslong war. Senator Dick Durbin brought an enlarged poster of Tyler Hicks\u2019s photograph of Amal Hussein, a 7-year-old girl who ultimately died of starvation, to the floor of Congress to argue for withdrawal of United States support for this conflict. The Senate later voted to withdraw American aid, the Saudi-led coalition paused its offensive, and peace talks began.\nBut these decisions are always tough.\nMARC LACEY To give you a sense of how difficult these decisions are, there are people in the newsroom who felt in retrospect that we shouldn\u2019t have run the Nairobi photo.\nAt one point early on, the top photo on the article was the one with dead bodies in it. When and why was it changed?\nLOORAM One of the considerations we weigh in publishing images like this is the prominence of the photo\u2019s placement on our platforms and on social media.\nIn this situation, we did not promote the photo on our social media accounts because it was so disturbing. As we listened to our readers\u2019 concerns about the photo, we also decided to move the image to a less prominent position in the article.\nDo you apply the same rules to your reporting on mass shootings in the United States and terrorist attacks in the West as you do to attacks in other parts of the world? Some readers have accused The Times of publishing far fewer graphic images of victims who are white or non-Western.\nLOORAM We do endeavor to apply the same rules to our choice of images from attacks in any part of the world. But these are weighty decisions, considered on a case-by-case basis by individuals.\nIt is important that as journalists, we carefully evaluate whether or not we may be applying any unconscious bias or varying standards to these decisions.\nWe have published images of victims of crime and terror attacks in the United States and other Western countries, including in this article from the Las Vegas shooting and this image from a crime scene in New York City. And here\u2019s one, even further back, from the Oklahoma City bombing.\nOur editors are only dealing with the universe of photographs that are available from any given news event. Press photographers in the United States and other Western countries do not always have the same access to crime scenes as those in the developing world.\nI personally can\u2019t recall having seen any images of victims of school shootings in the United States, so it is difficult to compare the two scenarios.\nLACEY If you go through the archives of The New York Times, you can find a number of photographs that depict dead Americans. They\u2019re there, as Meaghan pointed out. But I do think we can do a better job of having consistent standards that apply across the world.\nThe Times is a global news organization with readers everywhere. Gone are the days in which we can view our audience as an American one. We ought to make our standards decisions without regard to nationality. If we believe a particular type of photograph or article is too sensitive for an American audience, we ought to apply that same standard to a Kenyan audience, and a French one and a Mexican one.\nHow does the fact that more than 70 percent of our audience is in the United States play into our calculations? If we thought we had a mostly Kenyan audience, would we have published the same photo?\nLOORAM Historically, I think that American news organizations did tend to consider only a local or national audience, and thus may have applied different standards to material from locations broadly thought to be remote or \u201cover there,\u201d rather than close to home. I do think that as a global news organization, we must try to let go of this notion and make decisions based on the fact that we serve a global audience.\nLACEY I lived in Kenya for five years, and I have numerous friends who still live there. My immediate thought when I heard of this attack was whether someone I knew might be a victim. For me, this was not some faraway attack. It was a horrible incident in a place I knew well.\nDo we have a consistent policy for the publication of graphic images? If not, are there plans to implement one?\nLACEY As a result of the concerns from our readers that this photo raised, we\u2019re going to convene a group of people to come up with clearer guidelines. I am going to be part of that effort.\nLOORAM The group of journalists Marc is referring to will draft a guide for editors who are faced with making these kinds of consequential decisions.\nAs part of this process, we will create a set of questions to consider before publishing sensitive images. We must weigh our responsibility as journalists to help our readers see and understand the reality of the world with sensitivity to the victims and their families. We take both of these responsibilities very seriously.\nIt is also crucial to me as the director of photography that our editors are cognizant of issues of representation of people of color. We must not apply different standards, or give less consideration, to the dignity and humanity and pain of any group of people.\nWhy We Are Publishing Haunting Photos of Emaciated Yemeni ChildrenOct. 26, 2018\nDepicting, and Respecting, the Dead: Responses to Photos From Mount EverestDec. 21, 2017\nReaders and The Times Respond to Harvey Weinstein\u2019s Page One PortraitDec. 9, 2017\nA note to readers who are not subscribers: This article from the Reader Center does not count toward your monthly free article limit.\nFollow the @ReaderCenter on Twitter for more coverage highlighting your perspectives and experiences and for insight into how we work.", "headline": "Bulletin Board: Why The Times Published a Disturbing Photo of Dead Bodies After an Attack in Nairobi", "blurb": "A burial ceremony on Wednesday in Nairobi, Kenya, for Feisal Ahmed, who was killed in the attack.", "referenced_places": [{"name": "Kenya", "lat": 1.4419683, "lon": 38.4313975}, {"name": "United States", "lat": 39.7837304, "lon": -100.4458825}, {"name": "Yemen", "lat": 16.3471243, "lon": 47.8915271}]}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/17/world/europe/anastasia-vashukevich-nastya-rybka-detained.html?partner=rss&emc=rss": {"content": "A Belarusian escort who claimed to have audio recordings that could link Russia with President Trump\u2019s election was detained in Moscow on Thursday, according to Russian news agencies.\nThe escort, Anastasia Vashukevich, was deported from Thailand on Thursday after she and seven other defendants \u2014 five Russians and two Belarusians \u2014 pleaded guilty to charges of solicitation and conspiracy.

She said she could provide more than 16 hours of audio recordings that could shed light on Russian interference in the 2016 American presidential election.\nBy this point, Ms. Vashukevich had already gained a degree of online fame.\nHer Instagram videos of Sergei E. Prikhodko, then a deputy prime minister, and Oleg Deripaska, a billionaire with ties to the Kremlin, were featured prominently in a 25-minute video published by Aleksei A.

The video released by Mr. Navalny included a recording of Mr. Deripaska and Mr. Prikhodko talking about relations between the United States and Russia.\nAfter her arrest, Ms. Vashukevich expressed fear that the Thai authorities would deport her to Russia, where she had lived before moving to Thailand.\n\u201cI am afraid to go back,\u201d she said at the time. \u201cSome strange things can happen.\u201d\nBut a few months after she tried to bargain for freedom with the United States, Ms. Vashukevich said that she no longer intended to make any material she had public, and had instead sent copies to Mr. Deripaska.\n\u201cNow I just want to wait for Oleg\u2019s answer,\u201d she said last August. \u201cI just want to be friends.\u201d\nAt the Moscow airport on Thursday, Mr. Kirillov\u2019s wife said that Ms. Vashukevich had not changed her mind, according to Interfax.\n\u201cNastya has said it more than once and she can say it again,\u201d she said. \u201cShe\u2019s not ready to share any kind of confidential information.

Gen. Paul E. Funk II, then the commander of coalition forces fighting in Iraq and Syria, told me. \u201cThis is what stability looks like. This is what winning looks like.\u201d\nGeneral Funk was standing in a crowded marketplace in Manbij, Syria. He was surveying stalls where vendors not only hawked spices, gold jewelry, olive soap and fresh chicken, but also freely displayed women\u2019s undergarments and brightly colored clothes that the Islamic State banned before it was driven from the city in 2016.\nHe was with a delegation of two United States senators, their staffs and a military escort \u2014 none of whom wore body armor as they walked through the throngs. From the souk, the group strolled to a nearby restaurant, the Palace of Princes, for lunch with local leaders. It was July 2, 2018.\nSix months later, on Wednesday, a suicide bomber detonated his explosive vest outside that same restaurant, killing 15 people, including two American troops, a civilian employee of the Defense Intelligence Agency and a military contractor.\nThe Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack, raising questions about whether American personnel had become lulled into complacency, or if President Trump\u2019s announcement to withdraw American forces had emboldened the extremist group and upset Manbij\u2019s fragile stability.\nImage\nThe site of the suicide bombing targeting American forces in Manbij on Thursday, the day after the attack.\nCredit\nDelil Souleiman/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images\nI was with the delegation that day to write about a planned visit later in the afternoon to wartime prisons elsewhere in northern Syria, where a Kurdish militia was holding Islamic State detainees. But the first stop was Manbij, which the lawmakers wanted to see for other reasons, and I went along for the ride.\nThe delegation was led by two senators on the Armed Services Committee, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire. And while I had no plans to write about Manbij, out of journalistic habit, I took careful notes about what we saw.\nAfter we spent the previous evening at the American Embassy in Baghdad, the military flew us to northern Syria on a C-130 plane. Notably, while we were required to wear body armor whenever we were outside the embassy compound in Iraq, the military did not think such protection was necessary where we were going in Syria.\nAfter a brief stop at a patrol base, a convoy of armored vehicles drove us into Manbij. We went past a boat sculpture on a traffic circle where Islamic State fighters were said to have held public executions before the American-backed Kurdish militia drove the extremists from the city in 2016. The convoy passed through several security perimeters to reach the city center.\nThe scene in Manbij was vibrant, with throngs of people shopping and selling wares with no sense of peril from Islamist terrorism. Instead, the main fear focused on nearby Turkish military forces and whether they might attack to drive the Kurds from the Arab town. The American military was patrolling the area to help keep the peace.\nAfter the marketplace, the group strolled across a plaza that was said to once have been called Jewish Square. Mr. Graham remarked to me that the people of Manbij ought to rename it \u201cTrump Square.\u201d The implication was that that might make Mr. Trump less willing to abandon them.\nImage\nSenator Lindsey Graham at the Palace of Princes restaurant last July.\nCredit\nCharlie Savage/The New York Times\nAt the Palace of Princes restaurant, a favorite of American military advisers, the group walked down a short flight of stairs from the street level to a basement room with small round tables, decorated by tiled walls and paintings and cooled by ceiling fans.\nThere, waiters brought bottles of water and small cups of coffee along with seemingly endless waves of food \u2014 kebabs, chicken shawarma, yogurt, hummus, salads and many other delicacies. Over the food, the Americans met with the heads of the Manbij city council and other local leaders, who were working on a new constitution and laws, along with Kurdish militia leaders.\nThe Manbij residents talked about life under the Islamic State \u2014 the shuttering of schools, the forced dress code of black, the pervasive fear that kept people walking and speaking \u201clike robots.\u201d They made pitches for funding for things like fixing up a hospital where a dialysis machine and other equipment had been looted by the extremists.\nOne resident, Shikh Khalif, said he had owned a car dealership before the Syrian civil war began in 2011, and was now the leader of the New Syria Party, which formed last March. Mr. Graham asked him what his platform was, and why people should vote for him.\n\u201cMy hands are clean,\u201d Mr. Khalif said through a translator. \u201cI had no hand in killing people.\u201d\n\u201cPretty good,\u201d Mr. Graham said. \u201cNo corruption, no killing \u2014 goes a long way.\u201d He then asked what would happen if the United States were to leave Manbij.\nMr. Khalif replied that perhaps the Islamic State would return, or perhaps the region would fall under the control of the government of Syria\u2019s president, Bashar al-Assad, or even be occupied by the Turkish military.\n\u201cIt would be chaos,\u201d Mr. Khalif said.\nWhen the lunch was over, the American group thanked the restaurant\u2019s staff and walked back up the stairs to the sidewalk, preparing to take the convoy back out of town. But first, Mr. Graham and several of the people at the lunch posed, smiling for a photo.\nThey stood on the same spot that was transformed into a scene of carnage this week.\nAs ISIS Fighters Fill Prisons in Syria, Their Home Nations Look AwayJuly 18, 2018\nI\u2019ve Been Covering the Detention of Terrorism Suspects for 15 Years.

Visiting officials were welcomed to red booths and water pipes; two American senators dined there in July.\n\u201cThey stop here for chicken and shawarma whenever they have a patrol in the city,\u201d said Jassim al-Khalaf, 37, who sells vegetables nearby. \u201cPeople here are used to it, so it\u2019s not a new thing to see them.\u201d\nThe jihadists of the Islamic State noticed, too, dispatching a suicide bomber who blew himself up at the restaurant on Wednesday, killing at least 15 people, including four Americans: two service members, a Defense Department civilian and a military contractor.\nThat attack, in a Syrian town celebrated as an American-backed island of stability, raised troubling questions about whether the American military had developed a false sense of security in a conflict zone, where avoiding predictable routines like a regular lunch spot can be a matter of life and death.\nSeveral current and former Special Operations personnel, as well as other American officials who had worked in the region, said Thursday that the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, had exploited a vulnerability.\n\u201cISIS saw a target of opportunity, but they should have had better force protection,\u201d a Special Operations officer said, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the news media.\nA former senior officer, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Islamic State \u201cwill attack Americans anywhere and anytime they sense an opportunity.\u201d\nThe officials acknowledged that the dead and wounded, who included at least one Green Beret, had grown complacent and should have varied their patrol routes or increased their operational security.\n\u201cThe illusion of safety has always been a problem in northeast Syria,\u201d said one American official working in the region.\nIt was an easy lapse to fall into in Manbij, a small city in northeastern Syria near the border with Turkey. An American-led Kurdish-Arab coalition drove the Islamic State out of the city in mid-2016 and set up American-backed local councils who ran the place.\nAfter Turkey threatened to invade early last year to drive out Kurdish forces, which Turkey considers terrorist, the United States started running patrols from bases in the olive groves near town to keep one ally, Turkey, from attacking another, the Kurds.\nThe military presence made Manbij deceptively peaceful.\nOn a July visit, a delegation of American military leaders and senators wore no body armor as they walked through a crowded marketplace there, surveying stalls hawking spices, gold jewelry, olive soap and fresh chicken.\n\u201cPretty cool,\u201d said Lt. Gen. Paul E. Funk II, then the commander of coalition forces fighting in Iraq and Syria, \u201cThis is what stability looks like. This is what winning looks like.\u201d\nFrom there, the group, including Senators Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, and Jeanne Shaheen, Democrat of New Hampshire, strolled to the Palace of Princes for lunch with local leaders.\n\u201cWe had a very good tour and a terrific lunch,\u201d Senator Graham said afterward. Manbij, he said, was \u201ca place of hope in a region that needs more hope.\u201d\nThe restaurant\u2019s owner, Ali Saleh al-Yousef, also saw Manbij as a bright spot in a war-ravaged country.\nIn a recent local TV interview, he said that he left the city when the Islamic State took over and returned only once it was safe again.\n\u201cWe wish all the provinces in Syria could be like Manbij,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause now Manbij has become an example.\u201d\nImage\nSenator Lindsey Graham, center, dined at the Palace of Princes restaurant in July. He had \u201ca terrific lunch,\u201d he said.\nCredit\nCharlie Savage/The New York Times\nA two-story restaurant on a crowded downtown street, the Palace of Princes served meat grilled over charcoal, rotisserie chicken, shawarma and other dishes that made it a favorite stop for American soldiers on patrol.\nSometimes they would drop in to get sandwiches to go before rumbling back to their bases outside of town, residents said. Other times, they would park their armored vehicles in front and get a table.\nIf the Americans gave any thought to the cardinal importance of varying one\u2019s routines in a war zone to make it harder for enemies to plan attacks, it was not reflected in their eating habits.\n\u201cI know that whenever they went to the city because there was a patrol or a mission, they\u2019d pass by that restaurant,\u201d said Shervan Darwish, the spokesman for the Manbij Military Council, which works closely with the United States.\nOn Wednesday, one such patrol dropped in for a late lunch. Cars were double-parked in front of the restaurant and the sidewalks were full of people visiting the nearby vegetable market, according to residents and surveillance footage posted online.\nA suicide bomber mixed into the crowd and detonated his explosive vest near the restaurant entrance. A fireball erupted in front of the restaurant, yanking down its sign, toppling the rotisserie and leaving the dead and wounded scattered in the street, according to witnesses and videos posted online.\n\u201cWe saw civilians on the ground, kids, soldiers, fire still blazing in the shop,\u201d Ahmed Himo, a local journalist, said by phone on Thursday. \u201cIt was a terrible scene.\u201d\nAhmad Sulaiman, 12, was passing the restaurant on the way to his grandfather\u2019s house when the blast happened.\n\u201cWhen I passed, there was the man who makes the shawarma sandwiches,\u201d Ahmad said while being treated for leg injuries in a hospital. \u201cThen fire flashed and disappeared and the man was no longer there.\u201d\nWhile rescue workers rushed the wounded to the hospital, three helicopters appeared in the sky, Mr. Himo said. One tried to land in the street but it was too narrow, so it landed on a soccer field nearby. The dead and wounded Americans were taken there and flown away.\nOn Friday the Pentagon identified three of the Americans who were killed as Chief Warrant Officer Jonathan R. Farmer, 37, of Boynton Beach, Fla., a Special Forces soldier, or Green Beret; Chief Cryptologic Technician Shannon M. Kent, 35, of New York State, who was in the Navy; and Scott A. Wirtz, a Defense Intelligence Agency civilian employee, of St. Louis, Mo.\nThree other service members were wounded and flown to an American military hospital in Germany for treatment, a military official said.\nUntil this week, just two American service members had been killed in Syria.\nAllied aircraft bombed a mosque on Thursday that the Islamic State had used as a command center in Safafiyah, Syria, in the Middle Euphrates River Valley, the Pentagon said. It was unclear if the airstrike was in response to the attack in Manbij, scores of miles to the northwest, or, more likely, a target of opportunity.\nManbij was still in shock on Thursday, residents said, struggling to deal with the aftermath of the bombing and their town\u2019s uncertain future should Mr. Trump make good on his promise to withdraw American troops. Turkey has talked about invading. The Syrian government and its Russian and Iranian allies want the territory back. And the Islamic State has proved it still has the ability to strike.\nThe attack added fuel to the debate over the ever-shifting American mission in eastern Syria, and President Trump\u2019s plans to bring troops home.\nWhile Mr. Trump and, as recently as Wednesday, Vice President Mike Pence, insisted that the Islamic State had been defeated, a range of American officials, including many of Mr. Trump\u2019s allies, have said the attack proved otherwise and that leaving Syria could allow the jihadists to come roaring back.\nMr. Darwish, of the local military council, said that whether the United States ultimately withdraws or not, the existing confusion over American policy had emboldened the jihadists.\n\u201cISIS benefits from the tense atmosphere, the murky situation, the recent statements, the decision to withdraw and the tweets from all over,\u201d he said. \u201cThat has made the region unstable, and all of that helps ISIS to bring itself back together.\u201d\nHe said that an American withdrawal would leave a vacuum that the jihadists would be well positioned to exploit.\n\u201cISIS will benefit,\u201d he said.\nBut the deaths, in a part of Syria few Americans have heard of, also drew calls to remove the United States from another murky Middle Eastern battlefield.\n\u201cThe real danger is that these attacks will lead Trump and company to bow to the pressure of the Syria Washington hawks who are already saying that unless America stays, it will be portrayed as weak,\u201d said Aaron David Miller, a former Middle East analyst at the State Department. \u201cThis is a prescription for another forever war.\u201d", "headline": "A Favorite Restaurant in Syria Led ISIS to Americans", "blurb": "Senator Lindsey Graham, center, dined at the Palace of Princes restaurant in July.

Sign up to get it by email.\n___\nI\n\u2019m in Hong Kong this week for our annual meeting with New York Times editors and correspondents from all across Asia, and on the plane over I was reading Evan Osnos\u2019s book, \u201cAge of Ambition: Chasing Fortune, Truth, and Faith in the New China.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a fascinating read, far more about people than geopolitics (read our 2014 review), making it a strong introduction to some of the themes that many of us will continue to inquire about as the world grapples with China\u2019s growing impact.\nSome of the questions are almost existential: Has China proved that centralized authoritarianism works better for economic growth than decentralized democracy?\nOthers are more particular: How is China using technology to maintain and expand its power? How will China respond to the growing backlash to its policies forming in Australia, the United States and elsewhere?\nThese reporting targets, we hope, will yield interesting journalism throughout the year.\nBut our discussions in Hong Kong also covered the region. We have correspondents throughout Asia, reporting on politics, culture, business and technology; here are a few of the topics that led to robust conversations about our future coverage.\nThis is far from a comprehensive list, but consider it a bit of a preview for 2019.\nElections: India, the Philippines, Thailand \u2014 and Australia of course \u2014 all have elections scheduled for this year. Voters will be given stark choices about not just domestic policy, but also foreign affairs.\nDemographics: India has to create a million jobs each year to keep unemployment from rising; Japan is desperate for workers; China is desperate for babies. There are also intriguing stories about South Korea\u2019s aging populace, Australia\u2019s immigration debate and China\u2019s broader population dynamics \u2014 especially its overabundance of men.\nWomen: The role of women in the work force and in life, in Japan, in China, in Australia \u2014 these were all of interest to the group. What are the structures that maintain the status quo, how do they differ from country to country, and to what extent are they changing?\nTrump\u2019s world: Ah, the Americans \u2014 what an unpredictable lot! What many of us in the Indo-Pacific wanted to know is what the broader shift toward \u201cAmerica first\u201d means for the world. To what extent will the American relationship with South Korea and North Korea change? To what extent will the United States-China trade war undermine the global economy or create new relationships and alliances?\nThese are just a few of the subjects you\u2019ll see explored in The New York Times this year \u2014 and of course, in this newsletter, which aims to add a bit of perspective on Australia and the topics Australians care about.\nSign up to get it in your inbox each week if you haven\u2019t already, and join us in our NYT Australia Facebook group for additional discussion.\nNow here are a few of the stories that stood out for me this week, from Australia, Vanuatu and beyond.\n___\nWhere Do We Come From?\nImage\nA skull found at a prehistoric burial site near Teouma Bay, on the island nation of Vanuatu.\nCredit\nDavid Maurice Smith for The New York Times\n\u201cA faint aura of destiny seems to hover over Teouma Bay,\u201d writes Gideon Lewis-Kraus, in this ambitious magazine story told from Vanuatu about old bones that have led to sweeping claims about human history and settlement throughout the Pacific.\nGideon brilliantly explains both the controversial science that\u2019s transforming archaeology \u2014 and the risks that come from the perception of scientific certainty about ancient history.\nIf you read just one long story this week, read this one.\nFor those seeking a shorter way in, here are 5 takeaways from his report.\n___\nThe Brexit Fiasco\nImage\nPrime Minister Theresa May listening as the opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn spoke on Wednesday.\nCredit\nMark Duffy/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images\nFollowing Brexit\u2019s ups and downs can be exhausting.

The factories and their operations were discovered through a painstaking digital examination of open-source data.\n\u201cNorth Korea may be reluctant to share those locations precisely to make them harder to target,\u201d Jeffrey Lewis, an expert on North Korea at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in Monterey, Calif., said in a report published Thursday. \u201cIn other cases, however, the visits may have been related to the development of new missile-related systems that North Korea was not yet prepared to reveal.\u201d\nThe report about the sites comes as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo prepares to meet North Korea\u2019s nuclear negotiator, Kim Yong-chol, to discuss steps toward denuclearization in the North that could lay the groundwork for a second meeting between President Trump and Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader.\nImage\nMr. Kim visited another so-called machine plant in Panghyon in northwest North Korea in 2014 and 2015.

Their report included map coordinates for the six plants, three of which turned out to be next to sites of important missile tests overseen by Mr. Kim.\nSince he took power in 2011, Mr. Kim has rapidly accelerated his country\u2019s missile program, which culminated in a series of test flights of its Hwasong-14 and Hwasong-15 long-range missiles in 2017, some of them believed to be capable of reaching North America. Mr. Kim did so while frequently visiting weapons-related facilities, inspecting tests and feting officials and engineers involved in weapons development with parades, gala parties and heroes\u2019 titles.\nFollowing its last test of the Hwasong-15 intercontinental ballistic missile, conducted in November 2017, Mr. Kim announced a moratorium on nuclear and long-range missile tests, saying North Korea no longer needed them because it had completed its nuclear deterrent.\nAt his meeting with Mr. Trump last June in Singapore, Mr. Kim vowed to work toward the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula if Washington met his conditions, such as lifting sanctions and providing security guarantees for North Korea. In a New Year\u2019s Day speech this year, Mr. Kim indicated that his country was no longer making nuclear weapons.\nBut while he is engaged in diplomacy, Mr. Kim has yet to announce a timetable for dismantling his nuclear arsenal. Instead, his country is still operating its missile bases and is suspected of continuing to improve its missile capabilities, despite Mr. Trump\u2019s claims of progress in efforts to denuclearize the North.\nImage\nA machine plant making integrated circuits in Pyongyang, the capital, was visited by Mr. Kim three times from 2013 to 2016 and was described by the North Korean news media as \u201ca nice plant in a park.\u201d North Korea may well have chosen to obscure the location because of fears it would be a target for cyberattacks.\nCredit\nMiddlebury Institute of International Studies\nThe work by Dr. Lewis and Mr. Schmerler helps unveil the secretive nature of the North Korean missile program. United States intelligence officials believed some of the plants produced armored vehicles, light aircraft, machine tools or textiles. But until now, their probable links to the North\u2019s missile program had not been publicized.\nFrom 2012 to 2016, Mr. Kim made five publicized visits to what the North Korean state news media identified as a machine plant \u201cmanaged by Ho Chol-yong\u201d in northwest North Korea that was undergoing a significant expansion, Dr. Lewis and Mr. Schmerler said.\nAccording to their research, North Korea actually used this location to launch its Pukguksong-2 missile in February 2017. The test marked a major leap forward for the North because the medium-range ballistic missile used solid fuel, which makes it easier to hide, transport and launch and harder for the United States to target in a pre-emptive strike.\nThe test was dramatic enough at the time that aides to Mr. Trump and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan interrupted their dinner at the Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida to bring them early reports of the launch.\nNorth Korea also used the location to flight-test its Hwasong-12 intermediate-range ballistic missile in May 2017, another major stride for the North\u2019s missile program. The plant is now believed to be involved in the development of tracked launch vehicles for missiles, Dr. Lewis and Mr. Schmerler said.\nImage\nOne factory located by the researchers was believed to have two campuses, with the underground portion hidden near a textile plant.\nCredit\nMiddlebury Institute of International Studies\nMr. Kim visited another machine plant, supposedly \u201cmanaged by Jon Tong-ryol,\u201d in Panghyon in northwest North Korea in 2014 and 2015. When he visited the area again in July 2017, the North Korean leader watched the launch of the Hwasong-14, the country\u2019s first major test of an intercontinental ballistic missile, which Mr. Kim at the time mockingly called his Fourth of July \u201cgift\u201d for Mr. Trump.\nIn their report, Dr. Lewis and Mr. Schmerler also located a machine plant said to be managed by Ri Chol-ho in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, that makes integrated circuits. Mr. Kim visited there three times from 2013 to 2016 and the North Korean state news media has described it as \u201ca nice plant in a park.\u201d\nNorth Korea may well have chosen to obscure the location because of fears that a factory producing integrated circuits, crucial for space and missile applications, would be a target for American cyberattacks, the researchers said.\nThe Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the report\u2019s findings.\nNorth Korea keeps many of its weapons-related facilities underground to protect them from outside monitoring or attacks in case of war.\nOne factory Dr. Lewis and Mr. Schmerler located was believed to have two campuses, with the underground portion hidden near a textile plant. They learned that the North Korean state news media used different names when Mr. Kim visited the aboveground and underground facilities there, Dr. Lewis said by email.\n\u201cIn some cases, Kim was visiting factories that are largely located underground and the effort was likely an effort to keep the location of the underground plant a secret,\u201d he said.", "headline": "North Korea Obscures Leaders\u2019 Visits to Missile Development Sites, Report Says", "blurb": "Analysts have located six factories believed to be linked to North Korea\u2019s missile program, visits to which by the country\u2019s leaders were concealed by the state news media to protect them.", "referenced_places": [{"name": "Singapore", "lat": 1.2904753, "lon": 103.8520359}, {"name": "United States", "lat": 39.7837304, "lon": -100.4458825}, {"name": "Japan", "lat": 36.5748441, "lon": 139.2394179}, {"name": "North Korea", "lat": 40.3736611, "lon": 127.0870417}]}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/17/world/europe/prince-philip-car-accident.html?partner=rss&emc=rss": {"content": "LONDON \u2014 Prince Philip, the 97-year-old husband of Queen Elizabeth II of Britain, was involved on Thursday in a car crash while driving himself on a rural road north of London, injuring two women in another vehicle.\nThe prince was unhurt, as was a 9-month-old boy in the women\u2019s car, a Kia, the Norfolk police said.

The book, \u201cDiplomatic Atrocity: The Dark Secrets of the Jamal Khashoggi Murder,\u201d is written in Turkish and went on sale in December.\nSaudi officials have offered changing accounts of what happened to Mr. Khashoggi, who had gone to the consulate to pick up documents he needed to get married. At first, they claimed he had left the consulate building safely after an appointment there. Later, they said he had died in a struggle. Eventually, they said he had been killed and dismembered.\nThe kingdom says it has detained 18 people in the case, and 11 people were charged in Riyadh, the kingdom\u2019s capital, this month.\nThe book does not explain how the Turkish government obtained the recordings. But it does say that Turkish intelligence officials had gathered audio recordings from several locations in the consulate. Excerpts were later played for senior officials and their foreign counterparts, including Gina Haspel, director of the C.I.A.\nThe reporters identify one of the officials on the tapes as Maher Abdulaziz Mutreb, a security official and frequent companion of the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman. Mr. Mutreb is heard giving orders and directing the conversation with Mr. Khashoggi, the book says.\nTurkish officials identified Mr. Mutreb and others through sound analysis, the reporters write.\nThey say it was Mr. Mutreb who laid out the plan to Salah al-Tubaigy, a top forensic official of the Saudi government, telling him they would try to take Mr. Khashoggi back to Saudi Arabia. If Mr. Khashoggi resisted, \u201cWe will kill him here and get rid of the body,\u201d Mr. Mutreb told Mr. Tubaigy, according to the book.\nImage\nKing Salman of Saudi Arabia and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman meeting with Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s sons in Riyadh in October.\nCredit\nSaudi Press Agnecy\n\u201cJamal is tall, around 1.80 meters,\u201d Mr. Tubaigy is quoted as saying. \u201cThe joints of a sacrificial animal are easily split, but dismembering still will take time.\u201d\n\u201cI always worked on cadavers,\u201d he said. \u201cI know how to cut well.

Women need to have 2.1 children to maintain population levels \u2014 but the official fertility rate is currently 1.6 children per women, and even that number is disputed.\nGiven this trajectory, the academics estimated that the country\u2019s population could start shrinking in 2027. And some experts believe that could come sooner or has already begun.\nOne of the main reasons for the trend was long-term consequences from China\u2019s \u201cone child\u201d policy to slow population growth, experts said. The policy also created gender imbalances.\nWhy it matters: With fewer workers in the future, the government could struggle to pay for a population that is growing older and living longer.\nImage\nThe scene outside Parliament in London on Thursday.\nCredit\nNeil Hall/EPA, via Shutterstock\nBritain awaits Theresa May\u2019s Brexit Plan B\nThe prime minister has to return to Parliament by Monday with an updated blueprint for Britain\u2019s withdrawal from the E.U.

In 2006, a local unit of a South Korean company leased it and employed 20,000 people to build cargo ships. Then earlier this month, the company filed for bankruptcy, putting the site up for grabs.\nWhat now? Officials said two Chinese companies were among the several foreign firms expressing interest in the site. But the country\u2019s defense secretary is now suggesting keeping the shipyard under government control to keep it out of Beijing\u2019s hands.\nWhy it matters: The shipyard is changing hands amid growing concern about Chinese companies, even those that aren\u2019t government controlled, acting as proxies for Beijing\u2019s influence and espionage efforts.

It\u2019s definitely not the turnout I was looking for,\u201d said Peggy Baron, 53, a lawyer from Dublin, Ohio, who said that the first Washington march two years ago had been \u201cwall-to-wall women.\u201d\nImage\nPeople gathered at Freedom Plaza in Washington on Saturday for the Women\u2019s March.\nCredit\nSarah Silbiger/The New York Times\nBut as the morning progressed, throngs of marchers began to fill the plaza, and spirits visibly lifted.\n\u201cI came two years ago. It\u2019s definitely smaller, but the spirit is very much alive,\u201d said Rachel Stucky, 53, an educator from Salem, Ore. She added: \u201cThe experience I had two years ago was indescribable. I wanted to feel that way again.\u201d\nThe events around the country were partly a celebration of what has been achieved since the first march.

The New York-based leaders of the national Women\u2019s March group that planned the first march on Washington have been under fire for allegations of anti-Semitism.\n[Listen to the episode of The Daily on divisions in the Women\u2019s March.]\nTamika Mallory, co-president of Women\u2019s March, has publicly praised Louis Farrakhan, leader of the Nation of Islam, who is widely reviled for anti-Semitic speeches. The Women\u2019s March has issued a series of statements denouncing anti-Semitism and apologized for its delayed response to the controversy, but Ms. Mallory has declined to denounce Mr. Farrakhan himself.\nSome marchers said they were conflicted about whether to come, given the controversy over the anti-Semitism charges. In Washington, Trish Klein, Jody Kanikula and Amy Hain from Chicago said they had an intense discussion before deciding to make the trip.\nImage\nImages from the Women\u2019s March, clockwise from top left: Washington; Washington; New York; Atlanta.\nCredit\nClockwise from top left: Sarah Silbiger/The New York Times (2); Adrienne Grunwald for The New York Times; Audra Melton for The New York Times\nIn the end, they chose to do it, because \u201capathy is not an option,\u201d said Ms. Klein, a 39-year-old special education teacher.\nThe controversy over Mr. Farrakhan added to tensions that were already brewing between the national Women\u2019s March group and some of the local activists around the country who planned marches in their own hometowns.\n[Read our report on women\u2019s marches around the world.]\nOn Saturday, those divisions manifested themselves in two rival marches in New York and two in Philadelphia.\nImage\nLinda Sarsour, left, and Tamika Mallory, two of the organizers of the Women\u2019s March, walked together on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington on Saturday.\nCredit\nJoshua Roberts/Reuters\nIn New York, some marchers said they had done research to decide which event to attend, but many said they merely went to whichever was more conveniently located. The march held by the Women\u2019s March Alliance on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, which advertised its opposition to anti-Semitisim, attracted a crowd that stretched about 10 city blocks, although there was ample space between the marchers.\nAbout four miles south, in Foley Square, a rally planned by a group affiliated with the national Women\u2019s March attracted a modest crowd.\n\u201cI was worried that it was going to be small and it turns out it\u2019s small,\u201d said Donna McDonough, a 69-year-old registered nurse who traveled by train from Hamden, Conn. Noting the controversy, she said: \u201cI think Mallory should unequivocally boycott Farrakhan but no one should boycott this march. She doesn\u2019t represent the entire organization.\u201d\nImage\nDemonstrators in the Women\u2019s March in Los Angeles on Saturday walked toward City Hall.\nCredit\nJessica Pons for The New York Times\nIn Philadelphia, where the two rival events were separated by only a few hundred yards, many marchers weren\u2019t even aware of the difference between the events or didn\u2019t care.\nThe marches did not attract many high-profile national figures, although Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, who recently announced she was running for president in 2020, appeared at an event in Iowa. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez spoke at the Women\u2019s March Alliance rally, and Representative Ayanna Pressley spoke in Boston.\nIt is difficult to say how much the controversy depressed turnout.\nEven before the controversy, organizers of the Washington march debated the idea of trying to hold another big national demonstration, knowing it would be impossible to come close to the turnout of the first year, when more than half a million people gathered on the streets of the capital.\nImage\nRepresentative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, left of center, joined the throng of marchers in New York on Saturday.\nCredit\nEarl Wilson/The New York Times\nJo Reger, professor of sociology at Oakland University in Michigan, who studies feminist movements, said other factors that can depress turnout include activist burnout, and paradoxically, success.\n\u201cMarches or movements can lose some momentum when people see some of their issues being addressed,\u201d she said. \u201cWith the recent midterm elections, some may feel like the country is going in a different direction after the Trump election and that may lower the numbers participating.\u201d\nSome who marched in previous years said the controversy was just one more reason to stay home.\nSavannah Fritz, a 24-year-old supervisor at a homeless shelter who marched in Boston in 2017 and Philadelphia last year decided to sit out this year because she felt that the money spent on stages and portable toilets could be put to better use.\nImage\nParticipants at an event organized by state groups marched in the rain in Atlanta on Saturday.\nCredit\nAudra Melton for The New York Times\n\u201cI obviously know that protests are an important part of social justice, but I just feel like the money would be way better spent actually combating the issues the Trump administration has created,\u201d she said. The anti-Semitism charges, she said, also created a \u201cmajor hesitation.\u201d\nStill, there was evidence on Saturday that the political events of the last two years had inspired a new level activism among many women.\nLori Clarke, 62, a retired schoolteacher from Bucks County, Pa., said the 2018 women\u2019s march in Philadelphia was the first time she had attended a public protest.\n\u201cI\u2019m just a normal everyday average woman,\u201d Ms. Clark said. \u201cI would never have thought of coming out to protest.\u201d\n\u201cI hate crowds,\u201d she added. \u201cThe reality of a Trump administration hit home, and I felt that I needed my voice to be heard.\u201d\nAnd in Washington, Hilary Ruesch, a 38-year-old marketing director for a wine importer, said she and others had traveled from Brooklyn to \u201ccome back to where it all began.\u201d\nThey were members of a local chapter for the liberal grass-roots group Indivisible. The chapter has a mailing list of about 300 members, but in two years, the core of the group \u2014 the ones who could be counted on to do the grunt work of local political advocacy \u2014 had dwindled to about 50 people. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen some attrition,\u201d she said. But those who remain \u201care really dug in.\u201d\nAnd she said they played a small \u2014 but satisfying \u2014 role in the 2018 election that gave Democrats a working majority in the New York State Legislature, and in the subsequent lobbying campaign that ended this week with the Legislature\u2019s vote to liberalize the state\u2019s restrictive election laws.\n\u201cThis time there are not as many,\u201d Ms. Ruesch said of the march this year. \u201cBut it\u2019s a long battle.

But the scope of the storm remained impressive, with precipitation falling from southeast Missouri to upstate New York.\nAreas to the south and closer to the coast were expected to get a wintry cocktail of snow, sleet, rain and ice, followed by plummeting temperatures.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a complicated storm,\u201d said Rich Otto, a National Weather Service meteorologist, who said the \u201ckitchen sink\u201d of mixed precipitation was caused by a combination of cold air moving down from Canada and low pressure coming in from the south.\nThe storm continued to move briskly and was not expected to linger in the Northeast. Mr. Otto said he expected the worst to move past New York City, where only two or three inches were forecast, by Sunday morning. In New England, the storm was expected to pass by Sunday night.\nAs with any storm, National Weather Service offices across the country were busy providing detailed forecasts and updates. But this time their meteorologists were doing it without pay, a casualty of the federal government shutdown.\n\u201cThere\u2019s definitely a drain on morale,\u201d said Ray Martin, a senior meteorologist in the Weather Service office serving Washington and Baltimore. He said he knew colleagues with young children or a new house who were struggling. \u201cThere\u2019s a little bit of not feeling appreciated,\u201d he added.\nThough the snowstorm was not exactly surprising \u2014 it is January, after all \u2014 its impact has proved frightening, especially on transportation.\nA United Airlines plane slid off a concrete surface at Chicago O\u2019Hare International Airport on Saturday, while the plane was turning off a runway.

After a bumpy descent, the plane seemed to be coming in sideways just before touching down, said Benny Salz, a passenger on the flight. It hit the ground hard, fishtailed and slid into the grass just off the runway, said Mr. Salz, 30, a music producer and singer who lives in Los Angeles.\n\u201cPeople were definitely freaked out when we landed,\u201d he said.\nRoad conditions were also nasty. Two people died in Kohler, Wis., on Friday night after a car they were riding in slid off a slick, snow-covered interstate and struck a tree, the local police said. In Kansas, the state Department of Transportation said one of its drivers died Saturday morning in a crash south of Kansas City.\nOfficials urged drivers to take precautions. In Missouri, the Transportation Department said \u201croads continue to be slick\u201d and \u201cfolks are still driving too fast for the current conditions.\u201d In New York, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo banned tractor-trailers and buses on most interstates for the duration of the storm. And in Rhode Island, state troopers warned that residents might encounter icy roads if they left home to watch the New England Patriots play the Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday night.\n\u201cIf there is ever a weekend to stay in and binge-watch something, this may be it,\u201d said Gov. Phil Murphy of New Jersey, who declared a state of emergency starting at noon Saturday.\nMore than 2,000 flights were canceled across the country on Saturday, according to the flight-tracking site FlightAware, more than a quarter of those in Chicago. Dozens had been canceled in New York, Philadelphia and Boston.\nMany people complained that their flights had been canceled far in advance, only to see snowless skies at the time that they were supposed to take off.\nAirlines err on the side of caution when it comes to flight schedules, so as not to cause more chaos in their systems, said George Hamlin, an airline and commercial aerospace consultant. The fact that airlines have very few empty seats on a lot of flights means that rebooking travelers can be more difficult if they are forced to make a late cancellation, he said.\n\u201cThe problem is once you get a major airline system out of kilter, it is a huge problem to get it back working again,\u201d Mr. Hamlin said. \u201cSo the airlines have adopted a policy of doing this on a preventative basis.\u201d\nBut some travelers were able to find a silver lining amid the chaos.\nAs Dr. Jennifer Hartwell was in midflight from Austin, Tex., to Detroit on Friday evening, she saw that her connecting flight to Indianapolis had been delayed to the next morning. She sent a text message to her husband from the plane, asking him to book a rental car, then asked a flight attendant to see if there were other passengers who wanted to take the four-hour road trip with her.\nThree other passengers took her up. One of them had been racing to get home because of a death in the family and would have missed a memorial service if she had waited for the delayed flight, said Dr. Hartwell, a trauma surgeon.\nWhen they arrived in Indianapolis in the wee hours of Saturday morning, the father of the woman going to the memorial service embraced Dr. Hartwell.\n\u201cThank you very much for getting my daughter to me,\u201d he said through tears.\n\u201cIf you step back,\u201d Dr. Hartwell, 41, said, \u201cyou can make a connection with people that is meaningful and make the most out of the situation.\u201d", "headline": "Winter Storm Makes Travel Treacherous and Is Expected to Worsen as It Moves East", "blurb": "A Chicago street on Saturday, during a snowstorm that has complicated travel across the country.", "lat": 41.8755616, "lon": -87.6244212, "location_string": "Chicago", "referenced_places": [{"name": "Canada", "lat": 61.0666922, "lon": -107.9917071}]}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/18/us/government-shutdown-hurricanes-disasters.html?partner=rss&emc=rss": {"content": "For experts who make a living forecasting hurricanes, storm season is a year-round worry. When the tropics are calm, as they are now, researchers dive into data, analyze results, improve scientific models and train state and local officials on the latest technology that can help them make lifesaving decisions.\nBut the partial government shutdown \u2014 the longest in United States history \u2014 has brought much of that fieldwork and instruction to a halt. Most researchers have been furloughed, and training academies and courses have been canceled, with no makeup dates in sight.\nEmergency workers, such as firefighters, paramedics and physicians, rely on federal academies to earn national certifications, keep their training current and learn how to keep people safe during a disaster. The prolonged stalemate, though, has forced the cancellation of a five-day course at the National Hurricane Center in Florida for recently hired state and municipal emergency managers. And last month, when the shutdown began, some 50 trainees at the National Fire Academy in Maryland were sent home, their coursework incomplete, said Steve Reaves, the president of the union that represents Federal Emergency Management Agency workers.\nW. Craig Fugate, a former FEMA chief, warned that the missed workweeks would be difficult to make up before the next calamity strikes.\n\u201cIt\u2019s making us less prepared for the next disaster,\u201d Mr. Fugate said. \u201cAnd the longer it goes, the longer that\u2019s going to be evident.\u201d\nFEMA continues to serve communities where disasters have been declared, including wildfire survivors in California and hurricane survivors in Florida, North Carolina, Puerto Rico, Texas and the United States Virgin Islands. On a recent afternoon, a FEMA disaster recovery center in the Florida Panhandle saw a steady flow of people seeking assistance to pay for the damage caused by Hurricane Michael.\nBrock Long, the FEMA administrator, toured parts of Northwest Florida on Wednesday and acknowledged that while FEMA\u2019s emergency response to Hurricane Michael had been uninterrupted by the shutdown, long-term rebuilding work from Hurricane Irma, which hit in 2017, had stalled.\n\u201cMany of the staff have been furloughed at this point, and they\u2019re just not there to process the paperwork and go through the motions,\u201d Mr. Long told reporters in Panama City, adding that permanent construction made public buildings, roads and other infrastructure resilient to future storms.\nGov. Roy Cooper of North Carolina, which is still recovering from Hurricane Florence, urged President Trump in a letter last week to end the impasse, saying that critical rebuilding work \u201cis delayed with every day that federal funds are held in Washington.\u201d The governor, a Democrat, said that North Carolina was waiting for federal approval to spend $168 million from the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and to receive its share of nearly $1.7 billion that Congress set aside in September for storm-affected states.\nThere is only so much time for forecasters and emergency managers to prepare for the next hurricane season that begins in June, said Eric Blake, a hurricane specialist and union steward at the National Hurricane Center in Miami.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t change the date of hurricane season. That\u2019s what we\u2019re running up against,\u201d said Mr. Blake, who has been working without pay during the shutdown. \u201cYou lose those weeks.\u201d\nDay-to-day weather forecasting has not stopped during the shutdown. But instead of spending time integrating new data sources into existing forecasting models, to try to improve their accuracy in measuring a storm\u2019s track and intensity, most researchers have been furloughed, Mr. Blake said. A significant upgrade to the Global Forecast System model scheduled for completion by the end of March appears likely to be delayed.\nJulie Kay Roberts, a spokeswoman for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which houses the National Hurricane Center and other government agencies involved in weather forecasting, said the upgrade required about 50 more days of work.\n\u201cNOAA will resume implementation work on this upgrade when appropriations are restored,\u201d she said in a statement, adding that the existing model \u201cwill continue to run operationally with no degradation to performance or skill.\u201d\n\u201cAs we near the beginning of hurricane season in May, we will ensure all necessary preparation has taken place,\u201d Ms. Roberts said.\nBut before hurricane season, Mr. Reaves said, spring floods and tornadoes can wreak destruction in other regions of the country. Mr. Reaves, who is based in Fort Worth, Tex., also said that rescheduling training sessions and certification courses for emergency workers may be difficult. In some cases, as for firefighters, national certification is tied to particular federal funding for local agencies.\nHurricane training programs \u2014 a sort of Hurricane 101 for inexperienced emergency workers in storm-prone states \u2014 began in Florida after its devastating hit from Hurricane Andrew in 1992, said Mr. Fugate, the former FEMA chief. The National Hurricane Center holds three one-week courses every year. The courses typically run at capacity and provide instruction at no cost to trainees, Mr. Fugate said.\nThere are other academies, too. FEMA\u2019s Center for Domestic Preparedness in Anniston, Ala., is the only nonmilitary facility in the country that trains emergency workers, including hospital staffs, to respond to attacks by weapons of mass destruction.\nIn the long run, Mr. Fugate said he was concerned about vacant positions remaining unfilled in chronically understaffed agencies, like the National Weather Service, and that highly skilled scientists \u2014 both government employees and contractors \u2014 might leave the government for careers in the private sector, with few similarly experienced candidates to replace them.\n\u201cWe always struggled to keep up with hiring,\u201d Mr. Fugate said. \u201cNow people are going to start asking, \u2018How long can I stay in the federal government?\u2019\u201d", "headline": "\u2018It\u2019s Making Us Less Prepared\u2019: Shutdown Slows Planning for Hurricanes and Other Disasters", "blurb": "Damage caused by Hurricane Michael in Lynn Haven, Fla., in October.

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s last name during a Friday morning broadcast, nearly two weeks after another American newscaster was fired for a similar act.\nKevin Steincross, a veteran morning anchor on Fox2 St. Louis, was discussing an upcoming tribute to the civil rights leader when he pronounced Dr. King\u2019s last name as an anti-black slur during the 5 a.m. broadcast.\nHours later, during the 9 a.m. show, Mr. Steincross said the station had heard from a viewer that he had mispronounced the name.\n\u201cPlease know I have total respect for Dr. King, what he meant and continues to mean to our country,\u201d Mr. Steincross said. \u201cThis was not intentional in any way, and I sincerely apologize.\u201d\nTribune Broadcasting, the station\u2019s parent company, said that Mr. Steincross would not face disciplinary action. Mr. Steincross started at Fox2 as a general assignment reporter in 1996 and became a morning newscaster in 1998, according to the station\u2019s website.\n\u201cThe Fox2 management team spoke to Kevin following the mistake, and we believe that it was truly inadvertent and does not reflect Kevin\u2019s core beliefs,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cKevin is extremely upset by the mistake and regrets it deeply. We do not believe additional disciplinary measures are necessary.\u201d\nBut some people said the apology was not enough. The St. Louis chapter of the N.A.A.C.P. said on Twitter that it was \u201cunacceptable and very disappointing\u201d and called for Mr. Steincross to resign. Others on Twitter questioned how he could mix up the insult with Dr. King\u2019s name.\nDuring his lifetime, Dr. King\u2019s last name was often swapped out for the epithet, both by avowed racists and others who claimed to have used it mistakenly. More recently, American broadcast journalists have made similar utterances in 2005, 2010, and 2014, the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle reported.\nHeather Taylor, a sergeant in the St. Louis police force and president of the Ethical Society of Police, an association for African-American police officers in St. Louis, said the slur was so insulting because of the long history of its use against a man of towering stature.\n\u201cDr. King was murdered,\u201d she said in a phone interview. \u201cHe was assassinated fighting for equality. It\u2019s a joke in some communities with that term, and it\u2019s just not acceptable.\u201d\nSergeant Taylor said that using the slur in place of Dr. King\u2019s name was \u201cnot something that is normally a slip of the tongue.\u201d She believes that Mr. Steincross should be fired.\nThe incident attracted attention from people across the country on social media. Nadine Graham, a New York-based music writer, called it strange and disheartening.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t control what somebody has going on in their mind or maybe their everyday lingo,\" she said in a phone interview. \u201cBut on TV, you should be a little more careful.\u201d\nEarlier this month, Jeremy Kappell, then a meteorologist for WHEC Channel 10 in Rochester, N.Y., was fired after uttering the slur while describing a city park named for Dr. King. During an evening broadcast, Mr. Kappell said the slur and then corrected himself, repeating Dr. King\u2019s last name accurately.\nA WHEC employee saw a post about the slur on social media and alerted the station. As the clip shot around online, the mayor and City Council called for \u201creal consequences for the news personality involved and also for the management team that failed to immediately apologize.\u201d\nThe station\u2019s vice president and general manager, Richard A.

An applicant\u2019s race does not provide an automatic boost or guarantee admission, the university said. Rather, \u201cThis factor, like all others, is always considered in the context of everything else known about a candidate and in light of the range of contributions the candidate might make to the University.\u201d\nThe case has many similarities to a deeply divisive lawsuit that Students for Fair Admissions brought against Harvard, leading to a hard-fought trial last fall and a national conversation over the role of race in college admissions.\nBut unlike the Harvard case, which focused on whether the university was particularly unfair to one minority group, Asian-Americans, the U.N.C. case is more akin to high-profile affirmative action suits of the past, which accused schools of favoring black and Hispanic students over others.\nThe cases are also somewhat different in legal approaches. The plaintiffs accuse Harvard of violating federal civil rights law, and U.N.C. of violating civil rights law and the Constitution\u2019s Equal Protection Clause. Both lawsuits were tailored to reach the Supreme Court, and they amount to a two-pronged attack that maximizes the chances for a hearing.\nOriginally filed in 2014, both suits were engineered by Edward Blum, a conservative activist who opposes racial preferences. At this point it is a tossup which of the cases will reach the high court first. It is possible that if one gets there first, the Supreme Court could decide to call up the other as well, lawyers said.\nBoth sides in the U.N.C. suit asked a federal court judge to rule immediately in their favor, rather than allowing the case to go to trial.\nImage\nThe briefs were filed a few days after the chancellor ordered the removal of the remnants of a Confederate monument on campus.\nCredit\nJulia Wall/The News & Observer, via Associated Press\nThe filings cap a stressful week for U.N.C., whose chancellor, Carol Folt, ordered the removal of the last remnants of a Confederate monument on campus that had become a focus of racial tension, and then announced her resignation.\nIn an email to the U.N.C. community on Friday, Ms. Folt portrayed the suit as part of a coordinated campaign against race-conscious admissions policies at three leading universities, U.N.C., Harvard and the University of Texas. (Students for Fair Admissions filed a similar admissions suit against the University of Texas in state court in 2017.)\nShe sought to reassure students that no one on campus was underqualified. \u201cWe are proud of the contributions our students make in our community, and we want each of you to know that you rightfully earned your place here,\u201d she said.\nLike the Harvard suit, the U.N.C. case rests heavily on dueling statistical analyses, one for Students for Fair Admissions by Peter Arcidiacono, a Duke economist who is also the plaintiffs\u2019 expert in the Harvard case, and one for U.N.C. by Caroline Hoxby, a well-known economist and educational theorist at Stanford University.\nProfessor Arcidiacono found that racial preferences accounted for nearly a quarter of admissions for in-state Hispanic applicants and nearly 42 percent of admissions for in-state African-American applicants. Professor Hoxby, however, found that race affected just a tiny share \u2014 0.8 to 5.6 percent \u2014 of admissions decisions.\nU.N.C., a public flagship university, admits about 9,500 for a class of 4,000, of which 82 percent must be North Carolinians.\nThe plaintiffs argue that U.N.C. could achieve the racial and ethnic diversity it wants by focusing more heavily on socioeconomic and geographic factors in admissions. U.N.C. argued, echoing Harvard in its case, that such an approach would reduce both the diversity and educational excellence of the class. The U.N.C. brief said black and Hispanic students already feel marginalized, and that the approach proposed by the plaintiffs would leave them even more so.\n\u201cUniversity professors observe a lack of minorities in certain classes, fields or areas of campus,\u201d the U.N.C. brief says. \u201cIn turn, underrepresented minority students report feelings of isolation and unfair pressure to represent their race or ethnicity \u2014 effects that further impede education.\u201d\nIn the Harvard case, the plaintiffs are arguing that Harvard suppresses the number of Asian-American students admitted by holding them to a higher standard on grades and test scores, and by reaching for racial stereotypes to downgrade their applications. Harvard has said that it does not discriminate, and that the case is built on a flawed and hypothetical statistical model that does not reflect reality.\nThe judge in the Harvard case has asked for new closing arguments in February, and lawyers say that she may not rule until June.", "headline": "U.N.C.

Small towns notified residents that their plows might not keep up with the rapid snowfall, leaving streets impassable. And, in a foretaste of the chaos likely to ensnarl the country\u2019s transportation networks, hundreds of flights were canceled at Chicago\u2019s O\u2019Hare International Airport, before a single snowflake had fallen there.\nThe storm was also expected to further strain the National Weather Service, where many employees have been furloughed as part of the partial government shutdown. Others \u2014 including those putting out the storm warnings that state and local officials rely on for their planning \u2014 are considered essential and are working without pay.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been working for the National Weather Service for over 27 years \u2014 I\u2019ve never seen the morale as low as it is right now,\u201d said Dan Sobien, the president of the National Weather Service Employees Organization.\nHe said that the job of making forecasts in a major storm was inherently stressful, and would be doubly so at a time when employees were also worrying about how to pay basic expenses like rent and child care. \u201cWe\u2019re human beings,\u201d he said.\nThe weather system has already deluged the West, causing power losses, flooding, mudslides and deaths.

Were the needs and priorities of women of color overshadowed by the priorities of white women? What about transgender women?\nOn the eve of the third annual Women\u2019s March, which will take place Saturday, charges of infighting and anti-Semitism are hanging over the event.

In a letter to parents, the trip was described as an opportunity for students to live out their faith and demonstrate in support of all life \u201cborn and unborn.\u201d\nIn a statement, the Diocese of Covington and Covington Catholic High School condemned the behavior by the students and extended their \u201cdeepest apologies\u201d to the elder, as well as to Native Americans in general.\n\u201cThis behavior is opposed to the Church\u2019s teachings on the dignity and respect of the human person,\u201d the statement said.\nThe school\u2019s website and Facebook page were down as of Saturday afternoon.\nThe encounter became the latest touchpoint for racial tensions in America, particularly under Mr. Trump, who has painted immigrants in broad strokes as rapists and drug dealers and recently mocked Senator Elizabeth Warren with a reference to Wounded Knee and Little Bighorn, sacred ground for Native Americans whose ancestors fought and died there.\nAcross the country, Mr. Trump\u2019s name \u2014 and his campaign for a wall on the southern border with Mexico \u2014 have been used to goad minorities, including by high school students at sporting events.\n[Read more about the Wounded Knee massacre, the Battle of Little Bighorn and why the president invoked them to attack Senator Elizabeth Warren, a 2020 presidential candidate.]\nThe episode drew widespread condemnation from Native Americans, Catholics and politicians alike.\n\u201cThis veteran put his life on the line for our country,\u201d Representative Deb Haaland, a Democrat of New Mexico who recently became one of the first Native American women to serve in Congress, said on Twitter. \u201cThe students\u2019 display of blatant hate, disrespect, and intolerance is a signal of how common decency has decayed under this administration.

Mr. Phillips also holds an annual ceremony honoring Native American veterans in Arlington National Cemetery, the group said.\nMr. Phillips could not be reached for comment on Saturday. He told The Washington Post that he noticed the teenagers taunting participants at the Indigenous Peoples March.\n\u201cIt was getting ugly, and I was thinking: \u2018I\u2019ve got to find myself an exit out of this situation and finish my song at the Lincoln Memorial,\u2019\u201d Mr. Phillips told The Post. \u201cI started going that way, and that guy in the hat stood in my way and we were at an impasse.

A few thousand people attended the march to show that \u201cwe are still here and we still have issues we are raising and are concerned about,\u201d he said.\nThe exchange between the students and Mr. Phillips \u201cclearly demonstrates the validity of our concerns,\u201d Mr. Thompson said, who added that \u201ctraditional knowledge is being ignored by those who should listen most closely.\u201d\nBut in its statement, the Indigenous Peoples Movement also said that there was more to the rally at steps of the Lincoln Memorial \u2014 and the encounter with the high school students \u2014 than was shown in the videos.\n\u201cWhat is not being shown on the video is that the same youth and a few others became emotional because of the power, resilience and love we inherently carry in our DNA,\u201d another organizer, Nathalie Farfan, said. \u201cOur day on those steps ended with a round dance, while we chanted, \u2018We are still here.\u2019\u201d\nAlison Lundergan Grimes, Kentucky\u2019s Democratic secretary of state who graduated from a Catholic high school, said in statements on social media that she was alarmed to see the students from her state taunting and harassing Mr. Phillips.\n\u201cIn spite of these horrific scenes, I refuse to shame and solely blame these children for this type of behavior,\u201d she said. \u201cInstead, I turn to the adults.\u201d\nShe called on Covington Catholic to denounce the behavior. \u201cKentucky,\u201d she said, \u201cwe are better than this.\u201d", "headline": "Boys in \u2018Make America Great Again\u2019 Hats Mob Native Elder at Indigenous Peoples March", "blurb": "Video appeared to show students from Covington Catholic High School in Kentucky surround the elder, Nathan Phillips, outside the Lincoln Memorial.

He was 95.\nHis daughter, Sarah Glazer Khedouri, confirmed his death.\nOver more than a half-century, Mr. Glazer threw himself into the middle of heated debates over such contentious issues as race, ethnicity, immigration and education, contributing to a range of professional journals and popular magazines, and writing or editing more than a dozen books. He once said that he held positions often no different from those of many others\u2019, but that he was the one who would go to meetings and speak up.\nEarly in his career, he was a co-author of two seminal works on American society, \u201cThe Lonely Crowd,\u201d with David Riesman and Reuel Denney in 1950, and \u201cBeyond the Melting Pot,\u201d with Daniel Patrick Moynihan in 1963. Later volumes included \u201cWe Are All Multiculturalists Now\u201d in 1997 and \u201cFrom a Cause to a Style: Modernist Architecture\u2019s Encounter with the American City\u201d in 2007.\nHe was also an editor at the magazines Commentary and The Public Interest, and Doubleday Anchor Books. He served on presidential task forces on urban affairs and education, and held teaching positions at Bennington College, Smith College and the University of California, Berkeley. At his death, he was a professor emeritus of sociology and education at Harvard University.\nA child of Jewish immigrants from Warsaw, Nathan Glazer was born on Feb. 25, 1923, in New York City and spent his early years in East Harlem. His father, Louis, was a garment worker, and his mother, Tilly, was a homemaker. Nathan was the youngest of seven children, and when he was 10, the family, which was crammed into a four-room apartment, moved to the wider spaces of the East Bronx.\nMr. Glazer\u2019s interest in urban affairs stemmed directly from personal experience, and his upbringing had an impact on his later ideas. His East Harlem tenement block, dominated by the iron structures of elevated trains, had no trees or green strips. It was, Mr. Glazer once said, a \u201cbad place to live.\u201d\nOnly a few blocks away was Central Park, where a boy could lose himself in the meadows and woodlands, enjoying a respite from the city\u2019s noise and grime. For Mr. Glazer, the park was a \u201cwonder\u201d of childhood, and in years to come, when some urban planners challenged Frederick Law Olmsted\u2019s vision of a pastoral retreat within a crowded city, he spoke out in Olmsted\u2019s defense.\nMr. Glazer arrived at City College in 1940, near the end of the Great Depression and at a time when the all-male, predominantly Jewish student body was largely divided into antagonistic leftist factions \u2014 Stalinist, Trotskyist, Socialist. Having inherited a Socialist, anti-Communist perspective from his trade-unionist father, Mr. Glazer lined up against the Stalinists, joined a radical Zionist organization and edited its newspaper.\nAfter graduation, in 1944, he got a job at The Contemporary Jewish Record, soon to become Commentary. Mr. Glazer, who had come out of a \u201cvery narrow world,\u201d as he put it, described his life in the late 1940s and early \u203250s as leaving \u201cthe womb.\u201d\nIn the presidential election of 1948, he voted for the Socialist Norman Thomas, not the Democrat Harry S. Truman.\nTwo groups of thinkers that have had a lasting impact on American culture had a lasting impact on Mr. Glazer as well. The first was the New York Intellectuals, the collection of writers, gathered around Partisan Review and later The New York Review of Books, who combined leftist politics with modernist aesthetics. The Partisan Review writers Dwight Macdonald and Hannah Arendt were early influences; another contributor to the magazine, the art critic Clement Greenberg, helped get him his first job.\nWhile he was at Commentary, Mr. Glazer\u2019s circle widened. Writers like James Baldwin and Irving Howe would drop by the office, and at Greenwich Village parties he met prominent intellectuals like Lionel Trilling and the Partisan Review editors Philip Rahv and William Phillips. These were people, Mr. Glazer said, who seemed to be \u201cworking at the forefront of knowledge,\u201d with their understanding of Marx, Freud and Modernist developments in the arts.\n\u201cThere was an awful lot of talk,\u201d Mr. Glazer said, but he had always felt that he was something of an outsider, a \u201cjunior member\u201d at these get-togethers, \u201cmore like a hanger-on\u201d than a full participant.\nMr. Glazer\u2019s turn to neoconservatism followed an almost paradigmatic path. Throughout the 1950s, and even after he went to work for the Kennedy administration\u2019s Housing and Home Finance Agency in 1962-63, he continued to consider himself a radical. But if, as his longtime friend Irving Kristol put it, a neoconservative is a liberal who has been mugged by reality, then Mr. Glazer got hit over the head.\nHe had taken a teaching post at Berkeley in 1963, just as the student rebellions of the 1960s were erupting. Opposed to the growing American military involvement in Vietnam and supportive of social policies designed to help the poor, he initially sympathized with the student protesters. But as they grew more extreme \u2014 \u201cnihilistic\u201d was Mr. Glazer\u2019s word \u2014 he turned away from them and his own leftist past as well. He moved toward what he saw as a hard-won pragmatism but what others saw as a reactive conservatism.\nImage\nMr. Glazer, second from right, at a symposium in Boston on diversity in the academy in 1998. During the 1990s he decided that he had been wrong about the course of integration, as set out in his book \u201cAffirmative Discrimination,\u201d and concluded that some kind of multiculturalism was necessary for public education.\nCredit\nSuzanne Kreiter/The Boston Globe via Getty Images\nIn 1965, Mr. Glazer became one of the original contributors to The Public Interest, founded by Mr. Kristol and another friend, Daniel Bell. The magazine was a policy journal grounded in the concreteness of empirical evidence and asked hard questions about Great Society programs.\nIt became the most intellectually formidable of the neoconservative publications in the last decades of the 20th century, and one that Mr. Glazer edited with Mr. Kristol from 1973 until its demise in 2005.\nMr. Glazer\u2019s first marriage, to Ruth Slotkin, ended in divorce. He is survived by his wife, Sulochana (Raghavan) Glazer; three daughters from his first marriage, Sarah Glazer Khedouri, Elizabeth Glazer and Sophie Glazer; seven grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.\nDuring the battles of the 1970s over busing and affirmative action, Mr. Glazer published \u201cAffirmative Discrimination\u201d (1975), a landmark statement for neoconservatives and others opposed to government-enforced racial balancing. Mr. Glazer was prominently featured in one of the earliest studies of the group, Peter Steinfels\u2019s \u201cThe Neoconservatives: The Men Who Are Changing America\u2019s Politics\u201d in 1979.\nMr. Glazer was never an entirely reliable neoconservative. He wasn\u2019t comfortable with the label, and on foreign policy he continued to describe himself as \u201csomewhat left.\u201d If he opposed policies like affirmative action, it was not, as with more traditional conservatives, out of antipathy to government itself, but out of a skepticism about what public programs could accomplish.\nOne of his books was entitled \u201cThe Limits of Social Policy,\u201d published in 1988.\n\u201cOn most areas of public policy,\u201d he said, \u201cI consider myself pragmatic, rather than a man of the left or a man of the right.\u201d\nAs a social scientist, Mr. Glazer valued hard facts over good intentions. At the same time, he was modest about what the facts could show. A reader of his work was always coming upon phrases like \u201cI am not sure\u201d and \u201cWe do not have the knowledge\u201d and \u201cI do not know.\u201d\nThis meant that the nonideological Mr. Glazer could change his mind. In his writings on architecture and city planning, for example, he went from early enthusiasm for modernism to a \u201cgrowing disenchantment.\u201d\n\u201cIn the end,\u201d he said, \u201cthe defense of a radical modernism became the work of an elite that the ordinary person could not understand.\u201d\nDuring the 1990s Mr. Glazer decided that he had been wrong about the course of integration as set out in \u201cAffirmative Discrimination\u201d \u2014 that he had been complacent about racial progress in America.\nAnd once he had concluded that some kind of multiculturalism was necessary for public education, he bowed to what he saw as the inevitable: \u201cEven the most balanced and professional effort to define a curriculum for students in American schools today will place a heavy emphasis on multiplicity and diversity, race and ethnicity.\u201d\nIn Mr. Glazer\u2019s case, it seemed, a multiculturalist was a neoconservative who had been mugged by reality.\nFormer allies were not pleased. One historian of neoconservatism, writing in 2005, spoke of Mr. Glazer\u2019s \u201cdefection\u201d from the movement.\nYet there was an underlying consistency to Mr. Glazer\u2019s political and policy shifts. He had become a pessimist about the effectiveness of government programs and therefore a critic of much social policy. \u201cI know what I\u2019m against,\u201d he said.\nBut he said this more with sorrow than satisfaction. For if his skepticism compelled him to leave most of his radical past behind, he never fully abandoned his youthful concerns about social justice.\nLate in life he described himself as a \u201cmeliorist,\u201d and in a statement that can stand as his political testament, he declared: \u201cI think you must keep on trying, even if you haven\u2019t had great success. I think everything helps a little.\u201d", "headline": "Nathan Glazer, Urban Sociologist and Outspoken Intellectual, Dies at 95", "blurb": "Nathan Glazer, an American sociologist and author, in 1981.

But critics warned that they can enable mass surveillance or have unintended effects that we can\u2019t yet fully fathom.\nLauren A. Rhue, an assistant professor of information systems and analytics at the Wake Forest School of Business, said the #10YearChallenge could conceivably provide a relatively clean data set for a company that wanted to work on age-progression technology.\nBut she added that Facebook already has billions of photographs on its platform, and people should be wary of any company being in possession of such a large trove of biometric data.\n\u201cThe risk in giving up any type of biometric data to a company is that there\u2019s not enough transparency, not only about how the data is currently being used, but also the future uses for it,\u201d she said, pointing to another form of biometric data, DNA, which is increasingly being used by law enforcement to track down suspects \u2014 something many people might not have anticipated when they volunteered saliva in exchange for help tracing their ancestral roots.\n\u201cThere are things we don\u2019t think of as being threats,\u201d Professor Rhue said. \u201cAnd then five or 10 years from now, we realize that there is a threat, but the data has already been given.\u201d\nLike the rest of us, Facebook looked different 10 years ago. In 2009, the \u201cLike\u201d button was introduced, and the site unveiled a new home page to make it easier for people to see their friends\u2019 posts in real time. Facebook also reached 360 million active users in 2009; now, it has more than 2 billion.\nFacebook announced that it was using facial recognition technology in 2010. When people upload photos of their friends, Facebook can use the technology to suggest the names of people in the picture. It can also alert users if they are in a photo posted by a friend.\nFacebook has responded to concerns about photos and privacy in the past. The company said it does not intend to help strangers identify you, and has repeatedly pointed out that users can disable face recognition in their personal settings.\nAs for the 10-year challenge, Facebook said it\u2019s just a fun trend.\n\u201cThe 10-year challenge is a user-generated meme that started on its own, without our involvement,\u201d the company said on Twitter.\nSimilar memes have popped up in past years, too. But this time, users are grappling with new concerns about a platform that helps people to stay in touch with grandparents but has also been used as a tool of Russian interference.\nThe company faced several crises in 2018. In March, it was revealed that a political consulting firm linked to President Trump had improperly obtained data on as many as 87 million Facebook users. The New York Times reported in November that company leaders had tried to play down major concerns about privacy or deflect blame, and in December that Facebook gave big technology companies more intrusive access to users\u2019 personal data than it had previously disclosed.\n\u201cThe threat to privacy has become real to people in the last year,\u201d said Jennifer Lynch, the director of surveillance litigation for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights group. \u201cMy hope is that people will become concerned about this vast face recognition database that Facebook has amassed and push back on Facebook, turn off face recognition in our Facebook profiles, and push for strict privacy laws at the state and federal levels.\u201d\nMs. O\u2019Neill said she was glad that the meme \u2014 and her tweet \u2014 started such a broad conversation about facial recognition and privacy.\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of opportunities for technology to do wonderful things for humanity,\u201d she added. \u201cBut I think we need to recognize the potential downsides of it.\u201d", "headline": "#10YearChallenge: Harmless Trend or Boon to Facial Recognition Technology?", "blurb": "Facebook is one of many companies that has been using facial recognition technology for years.

Speaker Nancy Pelosi rejected it even before Mr. Trump spoke, and Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader, denounced the offer as \u201cnot a compromise but more hostage taking.\u201d\nWith the shutdown entering its fifth week and polls showing a majority of the public blaming Mr. Trump, the president\u2019s advisers have been searching for an exit strategy. Saturday\u2019s speech grew out of talks that Vice President Mike Pence and the president\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, have had in recent days with lawmakers including Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader.\nThe proposal was Mr. Trump\u2019s first public offer to Democrats since the partial shutdown began nearly a month ago. It came after an acrimonious week of tit-for-tat politics, in which Ms. Pelosi told the president he could not deliver his State of the Union address in the Capitol until the shutdown was over, and the president retaliated by grounding a plane that was supposed to take Ms. Pelosi on a fact-finding mission to Afghanistan.\nIn casting the plan as a compromise, the president sought to shift pressure to Democrats \u2014 who have repeatedly refused to give Mr. Trump any money for his border wall \u2014 to end the shutdown. But Democrats continued to insist they will not negotiate with Mr. Trump over border security until the government reopens.\nOver the course of his administration, Mr. Trump has repeatedly sought to curb both legal and illegal immigration. He has revoked Temporary Protected Status, or T.P.S., which offers crucial protections for immigrants, for people from some Latin American and African countries. And he has moved to rescind Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, an Obama-era program that shielded the young undocumented immigrants known as Dreamers from deportation.\nIn the deal he outlined on Saturday, Mr. Trump offered to restore T.P.S. protection for 300,000 people, and said he would allow 700,000 Dreamers to keep their protections for three more years in exchange for $5.7 billion for a border barrier.\n\u201cThat is our plan,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cBorder security, DACA, T.P.S. Many other things. Straightforward, fair, reasonable and common sense with lots of compromise.\u201d The proposal, Mr. Trump added, was intended to \u201cbreak the logjam and provide Congress with a path forward.\u201d\nThe speech was the second time during the shutdown that the president addressed the nation about the immigration crisis. But unlike his first address, a prime-time broadcast from the Oval Office that leaned heavily on dark messaging about the dangers of crime and illegal drugs flowing across the border, Mr. Trump seemed on Saturday to soften his tone.\nHe paired the address with his first naturalization ceremony at the White House, a move intended to underscore the idea that he supports legal immigration. And his language was markedly different; instead of insisting on the \u201cbig beautiful wall\u201d he promised during his 2016 campaign, Mr. Trump took care to use the word \u201cbarrier\u201d as well \u2014 and seemed to pare back his vision for it.\nCalling the wall \u201ca powerful and beautifully designed see-through steel barrier on our southern border,\u201d Mr. Trump said: \u201cThis is not a 2,000-mile concrete structure from sea to sea. These are steel barriers in high priority locations. Much of the border is already protected by natural barriers such as mountains and water.\u201d\nMr. Trump noted that he had adopted some Democratic proposals on border security. The president proposed $800 million for humanitarian assistance and $805 million for drug detection technology, in addition to funding for 2,750 more border agents and law enforcement officials and 75 new immigration judge teams.\nIn her talking points, issued to Democrats, Ms. Pelosi said her party favored \u201cnew drug, weapons and contraband scanning technology at official ports of entry,\u201d and \u201cfilling the more than 3,000 vacancies for customs officers.\u201d Ms. Pelosi also intends to bring up legislation in the coming days that includes an additional $1 billion for border security, including $563 million for 75 new immigration judges and support staff.\nEven so, Democrats roundly criticized the president\u2019s plan. They were particularly incensed that Mr. Trump\u2019s offer extended protections to Dreamers and T.P.S. recipients that he himself revoked. And they said the deal was a nonstarter because it did not offer any permanent protections for Dreamers.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s simply more fake promises raising false hopes,\u201d Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, said. \u201cIt will fool few Americans because it\u2019s neither serious nor credible as a real remedy for Dreamers.\u201d\nThe Border Wall: What Has Trump Built So Far?\nThe existing barrier isn\u2019t a single mile longer than it was when he took office.\nJan. 5, 2019\nSome on the right also pushed back, describing the proposal as amnesty. James Carafano, a national security expert at the Heritage Foundation who worked on Mr. Trump\u2019s transition, was among the critics. \u201cAmnesty encourages further illegal immigration, incentivizes the tragedy of human trafficking and undermines our citizens\u2019 confidence in the rule of law,\u201d he said.\nMr. Pence, briefing reporters after Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks, said the speech reflected a painstaking process of listening to lawmakers, including rank-and-file Democrats who made it clear they believed that protections for DACA and T.P.S. recipients must be included in a border security deal.\nAnd he pushed back forcefully against critics like Mr. Carafano who said the measure amounted to an unacceptable amnesty for undocumented immigrants.\n\u201cThere is no pathway to citizenship in this proposal,\u201d Mr. Pence said.\nBut that was one reason many Democrats considered it unacceptable. Other senior administration officials made it clear that part of Mr. Trump\u2019s strategy was to try to drive a wedge within the party between those who want to hold out for a much more generous solution and those who may feel enough political pressure to end the shutdown that they will feel obliged to support it.\nNoting that Tuesday is the deadline for the government to reopen in time to prevent federal employees from going a second consecutive pay period without a check, Mick Mulvaney, the acting chief of staff, said Senate Democrats had a tricky decision to make. He also noted that the president\u2019s ability to declare a national emergency was \u201cabsolutely\u201d still a tool available to Mr. Trump to find funds to build the wall if a legislative agreement could not be reached.\nNow it will be up to Mr. McConnell to put legislation incorporating Mr. Trump\u2019s proposal on the Senate floor.\nMr. McConnell \u2014 who has insisted he will not put any legislation on the floor unless the president will sign it \u2014 spoke to Mr. Trump, Mr. Kushner and Mr. Pence on Thursday night about finding a way forward.\nMr. McConnell told the president that before he could bring up legislation on the Senate floor, he needed a \u201cpublic reassurance\u201d that Mr. Trump would sign it, one person close to the talks said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to describe sensitive discussions.\nThe president\u2019s proposal \u201cstrikes a fair compromise by incorporating priorities from both sides of the aisle,\u201d Mr. McConnell said in a statement after Mr. Trump\u2019s speech.\nIf Mr. McConnell does indeed put a bill on the floor, as the president said he would, Senate Democrats will have to decide whether to block it or let it come up for a vote. Despite Democrats\u2019 vow to reject the measure, it could create an opening for negotiations between the two sides.\nThe shutdown stalemate is creating increasing nervousness on Capitol Hill, especially among Republicans seeking re-election in Democratic-leaning states. One of them, Senator Susan Collins of Maine, is among only a handful of Republicans who have broken with the president and called for the government to reopen without a border security deal.\nOn Saturday, she praised the president, saying she hoped that Mr. Trump\u2019s offer would \u201clead to constructive debate that will end this impasse.\u201d\nWhite House aides and allies of Mr. Trump said Saturday that Mr. Trump succeeded in ratcheting up the political pressure on Ms. Pelosi, especially if the Senate succeeded in passing a bill.\n\u201cThe Democrats\u2019 talking points have been that the president is solely responsible for shutting down the government,\u201d Marc Short, the former White House legislative director, said. \u201cThis puts more onus on them to come back and say why this proposal is insufficient.\u201d\nBut one reason Democrats are so leery of the deal is that they have been down this road with the president before. Last year, Mr. Trump and Mr. Schumer negotiated $25 billion in wall money for a pathway to citizenship for the Dreamers. But that deal fell apart when hard-line White House advisers persuaded the president to back away.\nThe standoff over the shutdown, some former aides noted, was the first time Mr. Trump has had to engage in meaningful, high-stakes negotiations. But even that has come as a last resort, in what some have likened to negotiating out of desperation after failing to score political points.", "headline": "Trump Offers Temporary Protections for \u2018Dreamers\u2019 in Exchange for Wall Funding", "blurb": "President Trump cast the proposal, which included $5.7 billion for a border barrier, as a compromise as he sought to shift pressure to Democrats to end the government shutdown.", "lat": 38.8950092, "lon": -77.0365625, "location_string": "Washington", "referenced_places": [{"name": "Afghanistan", "lat": 33.7680065, "lon": 66.2385139}]}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/19/us/politics/freshman-democrats-shutdown-wall.html?partner=rss&emc=rss": {"content": "WASHINGTON \u2014 As the most diverse freshman class in history settles into the House of Representatives, newcomers like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan have been racking up social media followers and soaking up the spotlight, liberal firebrands largely elected to safe Democratic seats.\nBut overlooked in the hallway protests and often glowing news media coverage, a larger group of more centrist Democrats has arrived with a different agenda. And now, they are quietly asserting their influence as the partial government shutdown, which has left them scrambling to explain why 800,000 workers are still without pay, enters its fifth week.\nThe centrists, elected to seats held last year by Republicans, delivered Democrats their House majority, and their re-elections will be critical to keeping the party in power. They include a sizable subset with backgrounds in military, intelligence and national security, and won by promising to work across the aisle and to end dysfunction in Washington. Now they are caught in the most dysfunctional situation of all \u2014 a record-breaking shutdown \u2014 and they are under pressure from constituents to do something about it.\n[The Latest: In White House Address, Trump Proposes DACA Deal in Exchange for Wall Funding]\nThis past week, a group of freshmen in Trump-leaning districts convened a private strategy session to discuss how they could press Speaker Nancy Pelosi to reclaim the issue of border security for Democrats and to open the door to negotiations with President Trump. Some also aired their frustrations with Representative Hakeem Jeffries, the chairman of the Democratic caucus, who hosted a small dinner for freshmen from battleground districts.\n\u201cWe have very real credibility on the border security issue,\u201d said Representative Jason Crow, Democrat of Colorado and a former Army ranger. \u201cI did two combat deployments to Afghanistan. Both of those were on the Afghan-Pakistan border interdicting drug and gun smuggling and insurgents coming across from Pakistan and the tribal regions. So I like to think I know a thing or two about border security, and you don\u2019t do it by building walls.\u201d\nMs. Pelosi appears ready to listen. When Congress returns to Washington in the coming week, she is expected to bring up legislation that will include an additional $1 billion for border security measures, including 75 additional immigration judges and infrastructure improvements at ports of entry \u2014 though no money for Mr. Trump\u2019s cherished border wall.\nShe is also weighing whether to propose a Democratic homeland security bill that could lay the foundation for talks with Mr. Trump \u2014 a step that would be a significant shift in strategy for the new majority, which has instead spent the past several weeks emphasizing the shutdown\u2019s emotional and financial toll on unpaid workers.\n\u201cAs someone who worked on preserving the homeland her entire life, I\u2019m ready to talk about homeland security,\u201d said Representative Elissa Slotkin, Democrat of Michigan, a former Pentagon official who also served in the C.I.A., and who organized the strategy session. \u201cI don\u2019t think we need a wall from sea to shining sea. But am I willing to talk about more fencing and more drones and technology and radar and border agents? Absolutely.\u201d\nOf the roughly 60 new Democrats in Congress, two-thirds, including a tight-knit group of 10 who are either veterans or have national security experience, flipped Republican seats. They represent a very different face of the party: pragmatic moderates who believe they were elected not just to resist the president but also to cooperate with him where they can.\n\u201cEvery single one of them ran on a platform of going out to Washington, shaking things up and getting things done,\u201d said Representative Cheri Bustos of Illinois, a member of Democratic leadership who focuses on electing Democrats in Trump districts. \u201cFrom the day they were sworn in, the government has been shut down, and they don\u2019t like it and the people they represent don\u2019t like it.\u201d\nSeveral of the freshman Democratic centrists, all members of a bipartisan group called the Problem Solvers Caucus, met with Mr. Trump at the White House this past week. Representative Abigail Spanberger of Virginia, a former C.I.A. operative who handled and recruited spies in Europe, said she told Mr. Trump that people in her district, including prison officials and Transportation Security Administration officers, are suffering. She said Mr. Trump did a surprising amount of listening.\n\u201cI can\u2019t speak for how he interpreted what we said, or how he listened to that information,\u201d she said, \u201cbut it was a calm meeting. Most people spoke multiple times, and so I found that to be a positive thing.\u201d\nImage\nRepresentative Elaine Luria, Democrat of Virginia, has been quietly reaching across the aisle to Republican freshmen to see if they can work together to break the shutdown stalemate.\nCredit\nErin Schaff for The New York Times\nBut while Democratic leaders understand the eagerness to quickly end the shutdown \u2014 a sentiment shared by Democrats across the philosophical spectrum \u2014 they are also urging caution, and sticking to their insistence that they will not negotiate with Mr. Trump on border security until the government is fully open.\n\u201cIt\u2019s fair to say that the freshman members of Congress, particularly the veterans and national security professionals, were sent to Washington to solve problems, and they would like to resolve the issue of border security in a bipartisan way,\u201d Mr. Jeffries said. \u201cThat is the position of the House Democratic caucus as well, but it\u2019s just a question of timing and the Republican willingness to stop acting like wholly owned subsidiaries of the Trump administration and engage in a meaningful conversation.\u201d\nAfter just three weeks in Washington, many of the centrists say the partisan split in the Capitol is even worse than they had imagined, and some have been quietly reaching out to freshman Republicans to see if they can find a way to bridge the divide and end the shutdown.\n\u201cWhen I think about being deployed on an aircraft carrier and we are simultaneously launching strikes against terrorist targets in Iraq and Afghanistan and I\u2019m supervising the operation at the nuclear reactors, I don\u2019t turn to one of the operators next to me and say, \u2018Are you a Democrat or a Republican?\u2019\u201d said Representative Elaine Luria, Democrat of Virginia, who spent 20 years as a surface warfare officer and nuclear engineer in the Navy. \u201cWe\u2019re all very frustrated by the partisanship.\u201d\nMs. Slotkin, who was an acting assistant secretary of defense under former President Barack Obama, described what she called a lack of evidence-based planning to secure the border.\n\u201cIf I was back at the Defense Department, we would look at an objective needs assessment for securing the border and we would build a budget to fund that security, and we would be negotiating on it,\u201d she said.\nBut she said that when she asked senior House members if such a document existed, she was told that the White House had its needs assessment and Democrats had theirs \u2014 and that neither was \u201ctruly objective.\u201d\nIn talking points issued to Democrats, Ms. Pelosi\u2019s office ticked off a list of items that the party favors as part of a plan for \u201cstrong, smart, effective border security,\u201d including scanning technology at ports of entry to screen for drugs and weapons, drones and radar to spot migrants crossing illegally, filling more than 3,000 vacancies for customs officers and building up infrastructure at official border crossings.\nThe \u201cservice candidates,\u201d as the veterans and national security professionals call themselves, see themselves taking a leading role in articulating that vision.\nIn addition to discussing the financial toll of the shutdown, Representative Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey, a former federal prosecutor and Navy pilot, said Democrats needed to start underlining the \u201csafety aspect\u201d as well: \u201cWhile we are arguing over border security, we\u2019re not paying our Customs and Border Patrol agents, so we\u2019re creating less security right now.\u201d\nBut the emphasis on border security may not sit well with their more progressive colleagues, who are more apt to talk about abolishing the Immigrations and Customs Enforcement agency than stopping the flow of drugs at the southern border with Mexico.\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we need to try to out-border security the Republicans at this point with this president,\u201d said Corbin Trent, the communications director for Ms. Ocasio-Cortez. \u201cIt makes more sense to focus on ways of creating an immigration system to bring people into this country to help build our economy and our society, rather than to help keep them out.\u201d\nBut Ms. Slotkin said it was time for the voices of those who flipped districts to be heard.\n\u201cBy the numbers, we should and do have a strong voice in the caucus,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cI think Alexandria has done a great job of attracting new young people into the political process and getting people engaged.

Mr. O\u2019Rourke had not endorsed Ms. Jones. In fact, he had elevated her Republican opponent, Representative Will Hurd, with frequent praise and, most memorably, a live-streamed bipartisan road trip that helped jump-start their midterm campaigns. Would Mr. O\u2019Rourke support the Democrat?\nHe would not.\n\u201cThis is a place where my politics and my job and my commitment to this country come into conflict,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Rourke said. \u201cI\u2019m going to put country over party.\u201d\nSome supporters of Ms. Jones saw it differently: Beto O\u2019Rourke was once again putting Beto O\u2019Rourke first.\nFive months later, as Mr. O\u2019Rourke considers a run for president, his decision not to back Ms. Jones lays bare the go-it-alone streak that has defined his career, separating him from a modern Democratic Party that has prized near-uniform opposition to Republicans in Washington. While supporters view his above-the-fray message as the foundation of his appeal, he has left important Democratic constituencies wondering if he can be fully trusted as an ally.\n\u201cBeto-first politics,\u201d said Jess Morales Rocketto, a Democratic operative who worked for Hillary Clinton in 2016. \u201cHe was concerned about Beto. I\u2019m not sure he was concerned about building the future of Democratic politics.\u201d\nIn Texas\u2019 23rd Congressional District, his choice was more than symbolic. Mr. Hurd won by fewer than 1,000 votes, and many voters and local activists hold Mr. O\u2019Rourke \u2014 whose success helped lift down-ballot candidates across the state \u2014 largely responsible for Ms. Jones\u2019s defeat.\n\u201cAll I kept thinking was, wait, Beto is supposed to be helping us because he\u2019s a Democrat,\u201d said Rosey R. Abuabara, the leader of TX-23 Indivisible, which worked to oust Mr. Hurd. \u201cI really felt like Beto was just getting in my way.\u201d\nMr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s aides noted that his campaign \u2014 and its sprawling grass-roots operation \u2014 had been enormously helpful to the party\u2019s cause, sharing voter information with fellow Democrats, opening hundreds of campaign offices and inviting other candidates to speak at his well-attended events.\nImage\nGina Ortiz Jones, a gay, Filipina-American Iraq war veteran, lost her congressional race in Texas\u2019s 23rd District by just over 900 votes.\nCredit\nLisa Krantz/The San Antonio Express-News, via Associated Press\n\u201cBeto fully invested in building the future of Democratic politics across Texas,\u201d his spokesman, Chris Evans, said in an email, adding that the campaign\u2019s efforts would serve as a foundation \u201cfor all future Democratic campaigns in the state.\u201d\nYet even some admirers of Mr. O\u2019Rourke have struggled to reconcile the snub of Ms. Jones, particularly in a year when female and nonwhite candidates like her helped lift Democrats to a House majority. Though Mr. O\u2019Rourke stayed neutral, Ms. Jones drew high-wattage help in the race, including from prominent Texas Democrats like Juli\u00e1n Castro, the former housing secretary who is running for president, and Wendy Davis, the former candidate for governor and abortion-rights activist.\nAsked whether Mr. O\u2019Rourke had a special responsibility to support a female candidate of color in this Democratic moment, Ms. Davis sounded almost anguished.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really hard to say,\u201d she said, adding that she did not mean to \u201cback-seat drive\u201d a friend\u2019s decision-making. \u201cI would feel that special duty. I personally would feel that. Beto\u2019s not me, and I\u2019m not Beto.\u201d\nMr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s very presence as a would-be presidential contender for 2020 is an issue of heated debate within the party. He is a prolific fund-raiser who proved he can energize younger voters, and some early polls place him third behind Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Senator Bernie Sanders, well ahead of many more decorated politicians. But he is also a relatively inexperienced lawmaker who lost his Senate race against Ted Cruz.\nFor close watchers of Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s rise, his approach to Ms. Jones\u2019s contest captured the twin pillars of his political worldview: He has an instinct for performative campaigning, reaching for multiplatform connection to voters but often lurching toward extreme oversharing. (Mr. O\u2019Rourke was widely mocked recently after turning the camera on his own dental appointment.)\nAnd he has often defied the wishes of his fellow Democrats, especially traditional party leaders, who have eyed him warily since he challenged a Democratic incumbent in 2012 to reach Congress in the first place.\nThrough a fluke of weather, timing and internet trendsetting, Mr. Hurd sits at the intersection of it all. Until March 2017, he and Mr. O\u2019Rourke had been friendly enough as district neighbors, but never especially close. Then, after a snowstorm grounded their flights from Texas to Washington, Mr. O\u2019Rourke suggested they drive instead \u2014 and record themselves for all 1,600 miles, answering questions from followers along the way.\nAlone in their rented Chevy Impala, they sang along to Willie Nelson, hashed out health care and trade policy and made a late-night doughnut run in Tennessee, attracting hundreds of thousands of viewers and wide-scale media coverage. Newt Gingrich called in to salute them. Mark Zuckerberg chimed in approvingly on Facebook.\nImage\nIn early 2017, Mr. O\u2019Rourke and Representative Will Hurd, a Republican, live-streamed a road trip from Texas to Washington.\n\u201cOur party leadership is probably not super excited that we\u2019re doing this,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Rourke said at one point.\nHe was half right. Democrats in Washington, who had eyed Mr. Hurd\u2019s seat as a prime pickup opportunity after Mrs. Clinton carried the district in 2016, winced at the sight of Mr. O\u2019Rourke bolstering Mr. Hurd\u2019s reputation for bipartisanship. Republicans were delighted to have a high-profile showcase for Mr. Hurd\u2019s personality and moderate image.\nHis congenial political brand helped him establish a consistent lead over Ms. Jones in private polling, giving pause to some national groups, like the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, about investing in the race.\n\u201cIt was a huge boost for us,\u201d Matt Gorman, the communications director for the National Republican Congressional Committee during the midterms, said of the road trip. \u201cThat thing went totally viral.\u201d\nMark McKinnon, a veteran of Texas politics who was an adviser to George W. Bush, said by email that the road trip became a \u201clife preserver for Hurd and launchpad for Beto.\u201d\nMr. O\u2019Rourke and his team seemed to recognize this. The ride registered as his campaign\u2019s unofficial kickoff. And he was quick to invoke his relationship with Mr. Hurd, to deflect attacks from Mr. Cruz that he was too far left for Texas, and to burnish his self-styled standing as a high-minded antidote to the Capitol\u2019s seemingly intransigent partisanship.\n\u201cI know how disappointing it is to people,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Rourke said in an interview last summer, explaining his decision not to support Ms. Jones. \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing for very legitimate, really important reasons. Like, I also want to be in the majority.\u201d\nHe added that Ms. Jones would make an excellent congresswoman if elected.\nParty officials and activists kept up the pressure, cornering him at rallies and fund-raisers, including one in San Antonio where Mr. O\u2019Rourke raised his right hand in a mock ceremony and pledged not to make Mr. Hurd \u201clook cool\u201d even as he refused to oppose him.\n\u201cBasically I told him he needed to dance with who brung him,\u201d said Mary Bell Lockhart, the chairwoman of the Brewster County Democratic Party. \u201cAnd it was primarily Democrats.\u201d\nImage\nMr. O\u2019Rourke is a prolific fund-raiser who proved he can energize younger voters. Some early polls place him third behind Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Senator Bernie Sanders, well ahead of many more decorated politicians who might seek the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020.\nCredit\nTodd Heisler/The New York Times\nMr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s supporters insist he can be counted on to pursue Democratic priorities, while noting that his relationship with Mr. Hurd allowed the two to collaborate on shared causes like border policy. (Mr. Hurd has been a rare Republican opposing the construction of a wall.)\nBut Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s history with the party is more complicated than it appeared in a binary race against Mr. Cruz, whom Democrats could generally agree to loathe. He was known in Washington for declining to pay dues to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. In 2016, he voted against Nancy Pelosi to lead the Democratic caucus, supporting Tim Ryan, a centrist from Ohio.\n\u201cWe are all products of our environment,\u201d said Pete Gallego, a former Democratic congressman who lost his seat to Mr. Hurd in 2014. \u201cHe has found tremendous success by shaking things up and by not being part of the party apparatus.\u201d\nAfter Ms. Jones won the Democratic nomination for the seat, she and Mr. O\u2019Rourke had a cordial conversation by telephone. Mr. O\u2019Rourke neither pledged to help Ms. Jones nor told her directly that he would be withholding his support, according to people briefed on the call.\nIn late June, Ronald Smith, a liberal activist in Mr. Hurd\u2019s district, emailed Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign demanding to know: \u201cHas Beto endorsed Gina Ortiz Jones? If not, when will he endorse her?\u201d Mr. Smith said he wanted \u201ca team player for my next Democratic senator.\u201d\nAn O\u2019Rourke campaign representative offered a noncommittal reply in an email reviewed by The New York Times: \u201cWe are evaluating some local and regional races at this time.\u201d\nBy the summer, aides to Mr. O\u2019Rourke had made clear to Ms. Jones\u2019s campaign that he would not support her candidacy, three Democrats familiar with the exchange said. Mr. O\u2019Rourke valued his relationship with Mr. Hurd and was mentioning it frequently on the campaign trail, as he sought to win crossover support from right-of-center voters.\nMs. Jones, who has said she is likely to run again in 2020, declined through an aide to be interviewed about Mr. O\u2019Rourke.\nMr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s defenders note that several Democrats benefited from his stronger-than-expected showing against Mr. Cruz, helping the party flip congressional seats in the Houston and Dallas areas.\nBut in no other swing district was Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s allegiance in question. Mr. O\u2019Rourke carried the 23rd District even as Mr. Hurd narrowly won re-election there. In the section of the district that spills into Bexar County, home to San Antonio, Mr. O\u2019Rourke outperformed Mr. Cruz by about 3,900 votes, a review of precinct-level election results found. The same set of precincts voted for Mr. Hurd over Ms. Jones by nearly 4,700 votes. Mr. Hurd won the district by just over 900 votes.\n\u201cWe know exactly what the Beto bump was and it was amazing,\u201d said Mr. Smith, the liberal activist. \u201cBut my assessment was, for Democrats, as well as we did this last election cycle, we would have had one more seat if Beto had been on board with Gina Ortiz Jones.\u201d", "headline": "As Beto O\u2019Rourke Weighs 2020 Run, Democrats Chafe at His Go-It-Alone Style", "blurb": "Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s decision not to endorse a fellow Democrat in a competitive congressional race last year put him at odds with his party\u2019s strategy of near-uniform opposition to Republicans in Washington.", "referenced_places": [{"name": "Iraq", "lat": 33.0955793, "lon": 44.1749775}]}, "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/19/us/is-it-diverse-if-it-leaves-you-out.html?partner=rss&emc=rss": {"content": "Please sign up here to have the Race/Related newsletter delivered weekly to your inbox.\nWhat exactly is diversity?\nOn Jan. 11, CBS News announced it had expanded its political team in preparation for the 2020 presidential campaign.\nThe announcement included a photo of the network\u2019s 12 new presidential campaign reporters and associate producers.

Many news organizations are still struggling to diversify their staffs, The New York Times included.\nI\u2019m a black woman who is an editor in a newsroom. I think it\u2019s important that black people are represented in the editorial process, soup to nuts \u2014 editors, correspondents, producers, photographers, digital, print, you name it.\nHowever, as the backlash to the CBS News announcement played out, a question lingered in my mind: If black reporters had been represented, but, say, Asian-Americans or Hispanic-Americans or Muslim-Americans had not, what type of furor would have occurred, if any? Why or why not?\nI plan to spend more time focused on this question in 2019.\nCBS News didn\u2019t take any of this lying down, by the way. It clarified that the digital journalists and field reporters included in the photo were part of an \u201cinitial wave\u201d of journalists who would be embedded with 2020 candidates. It also pointed out that Lorna Jones, a black woman, had been promoted to oversee much of the network\u2019s political coverage.\nIt should be said that CBS is in a moment of transition. Susan Zirinsky, who will be the first woman to run CBS News, is taking over from David Rhodes in March.

But the intersection of yogi and veteran is natural if unexpected, beginning with the five classic yoga poses known as warriors.\nWhile veterans make up a small percentage of yoga instructors, their ranks are growing. Many members of the military now often include yoga \u2014 sometimes taught by veterans \u2014 as an element of their workout routine, and veterans turn to the practice for therapeutic applications. The Department of Veterans Affairs has successfully used yoga to help treat opioid addiction and post-traumatic stress.\n\u201cA lot of vets have post-traumatic stress,\u201d said Thierry Chiapello, who served in the Marines and now teaches yoga at the National Defense University in Washington. \u201cBy lengthening the exhalation of breath, this gets people out of those fight-or-flight instincts that drain you,\u201d he continued, putting them in a mode of \u201crest and recovery that definitely is associated with less aggressive behaviors.\u201d\nVeterans, long schooled in discipline and concentration, also make excellent yoga teachers, both to other veterans, whose experiences they understand, and to active-duty military members, whose trust they often gain. They are becoming a welcome addition in civilian yoga studios, where students are usually attracted to their compassionate yet frequently no-nonsense approach.\nHere are some veterans who have become yoga teachers \u2014 from various service branches, eras and parts of the country \u2014 reflecting on the transition.\nHUNTINGTON BEACH, CALIF.\nChristian Allaire\nRetired Coast Guard; chief operating officer, Veterans Yoga Project; and teacher at Yoga Tribe in Huntington Beach and Purple Yoga in Long Beach, Calif.\nImage\nCredit\nChristie Hemm Klok for The New York Times\n\u201cThere are huge synergies with the military and yoga,\u201d said Mr. Allaire, who discovered this as he learned yoga. \u201cThere is a stereotype that yogis are a bunch of hippie types of people who are not militaristic,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the whole system of yoga is about moral and ethical restraints on behavior and trying to stay calm in challenging conditions.

That is one little thing that no one would ever connect.\u201d\nMr. Allaire experiences the service-driven life of yoga through his work for the Veterans Yoga Project, which provides yoga to roughly 1,000 veterans and their families per week as well as trains prospective teachers. \u201cWe will have four or five people in a conference room at a V.A.,\u201d he said. \u201cThere might be an Iraq war vet in his 20s, a Korean War vet in his 80s, some can barely move, some may be missing limbs and the teacher\u2019s job is to create space for a person to do a twist.

We teach them to breathe more deeply in their body.\u201d\nImage\nCredit\nCole Wilson for The New York Times\nMr. Riley notes that teaching veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder requires precautions. \u201cFor instance, I teach with my back to the door,\u201d he said. \u201cBy allowing veterans to see the door, it gives them a little more ease in their body.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cAs I move, I try not to move too much. I don\u2019t do a lot of hands-on adjustments. There is a space with vets that I don\u2019t violate. I don\u2019t get too close sometimes, I allow them to feel what is coming up and sometimes it doesn\u2019t feel good and that\u2019s O.K. It is difficult, but you have to sit with it if you really want to heal.

I know it works. Since 2012 when I went to the V.A. and started practicing yoga, my relationship with my children has improved tremendously.

When I teach the military, I teach a pretty power-focused class. I tend to hold poses longer and talk more specifically.

I try to really focus on the breathing what would happen if you just let gravity take over,\u201d he explained\n\u201cMy passion is getting men into yoga and trying to get them connected to themselves, the pain they are feeling and the things they need to let go. It is incredible to see people learn that it is not about getting into the pose,\u201d Mr. Johnson said. \u201cSoldiers are very good at being in the moment, much better than I have seen with a lot of civilian yogis. But what I am learning is that it doesn\u2019t matter if you are a former military vet who served four terms in Iraq or a housewife with four kids and anxiety issues.

At Blaine Fortner\u2019s pawnshop in Billings, Mont., there has been a slow but steady increase in one segment of his clientele pawning these and other items in exchange for cash: employees of the federal government.\nAs the longest government shutdown in American history continues, federal workers who are not getting paid are increasingly turning to pawnbrokers for short-term loans.\nThe turnout is small \u2014 a few people per day \u2014 pawnbrokers said, with similar stories emerging from places like Capitol Heights, Md.; Alexandria, Va.; Las Vegas; and Anchorage, Alaska. But many said they expected the numbers to increase amid the stalemate.\n\u201cThey\u2019re just bringing more and more in because they\u2019re getting behind,\u201d Mr. Fortner said.\nAbout 800,000 federal workers have missed a paycheck during the nearly monthlong shutdown. Thousands have filed for unemployment. Private businesses, banks and charitable organizations are offering help in the form of suspended fees and food banks.\nPawnbrokers said they were essentially providing another form of assistance.\nIn Billings, an average of about three federal workers walk into his shop, Yellowstone Pawn, each day, Mr. Fortner said.\nSome are what Mr. Fortner calls \u201cregulars,\u201d federal employees with cash flow problems who have made good use of his shop before. Billings has a federal courthouse and offices for the Department of the Interior and the Bureau of Reclamation, among others.\nBut there are also new faces, like the man who recently came in with high-quality Pendleton Blankets and said he had been furloughed by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. The blankets, if new, would probably cost a few hundred dollars. Mr. Fortner gave him about $50.\n\u201cHe just mentioned that things were getting a little tight,\u201d Mr. Fortner said.\nA typical pawn works like this: The pawnbroker lends money to customers based, in part, on the value of collateral that they bring into the shop, like the blankets.\nCustomers pay interest on that loan, which lasts for a few months. The exact amount varies by business and is also based on regulations in each state. Mr. Fortner, for example, charges 20 percent interest per month and he holds items for two months.\nImage\nSeveral pawnbrokers said the most common items federal workers are exchanging for loans are televisions, jewelry and tools.\nCredit\nJanie Osborne for The New York Times\nThe customer can either repay the loan in full and get the item back, or the pawnbroker gets to keep the merchandise and sell it.\nIn theory, because federal employees most likely will get back pay when the shutdown ends, they should be able to recover items they pawned.\nBut Mr. Fortner said that about six times a day, he gets a call from a federal worker who pawned an item and is worried about paying the loan back.\nMichael Mack, owner of Max Pawn in Las Vegas, said he is seeing a similar uptick in federal workers in his store. Mr. Mack said he was offering to waive the interest payments for furloughed federal workers for four-month loans.\n\u201cWe\u2019re dealing with people that are affected by cash flow problems all the time,\u201d Mr. Mack said. \"These are people that didn\u2019t plan on it at all.\u201d\nMr. Mack said one woman came in last month and said her family was visiting from California and that she did not have enough money for Christmas dinner.

It\u2019s also beginning to affect federal court funding and criminal justice reform.\nBut as the effects spread, Washington is still at a stalemate. President Trump rejected a proposal from the Republican senator Lindsey Graham on Monday to temporarily reopen the government in an effort to jump-start negotiations with Democrats. Democrats, in turn, rejected an invite from Mr. Trump on Tuesday to discuss the shutdown over lunch at the White House.\nThe House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, asked Mr. Trump on Wednesday to scrap or delay his State of the Union address, citing security and logistical concerns stemming from the shutdown. Mr. Trump retaliated on Thursday by grounding the military plane that was going to take the speaker and other lawmakers to Afghanistan, a trip he called a \u201cpublic relations event.\u201d Ms. Pelosi ultimately postponed her plans, saying that Mr. Trump\u2019s announcement \u201chad significantly increased the danger\u201d of the trip.\nLawmakers are beginning to float the idea that perhaps federal workers shouldn\u2019t show up to work at all; House Democrats are contemplating a homeland security spending measure with their own ideas for securing the border; and Mr. Trump is growing increasingly anxious.\nAdditional Reading\n\u2022 Shutdown\u2019s Economic Damage Starts to Pile Up, Threatening an End to Growth\n\u2022 Republicans Are in Lock Step With Trump on Shutdown.

(He later said that he wasn\u2019t.) This week, it emerged that Mr. Trump has repeatedly withheld details of his conversations with the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, from his own aides, even taking notes from an interpreter who attended one of their meetings.\nThroughout his presidency, Mr. Trump has insisted that there was \u201cno collusion\u201d with Russia during his 2016 campaign. But on each of the five times he has met with Mr. Putin since taking office, he has fueled suspicions about their relationship.\nRudolph W. Giuliani, the president\u2019s lawyer, backtracked on Thursday from earlier remarks in which he seemed to leave open the possibility that Trump campaign aides had coordinated with Russia in its election interference.\nAfter Mr. Trump made cryptic comments about his former attorney Michael Cohen, top Democrats in Congress warned Sunday that any effort to discourage or influence a witness\u2019s testimony could be construed as a crime. On Friday, BuzzFeed News reported that Mr. Trump had directed Mr. Cohen to lie to Congress about negotiations to build a Trump skyscraper in Moscow.
