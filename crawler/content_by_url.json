{"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/19/world/americas/hidalgo-explosion-mexico-pipeline.html?partner=rss&emc=rss": {"content": "TLAHUELILPAN, Mexico \u2014 Mexico\u2019s president vowed on Saturday to redouble his fight against an epidemic of fuel theft after thieves punctured a pipeline north of Mexico City, causing an explosion that killed at least 73 people and injured 74 others.\nThe blast underscored the deadly perils of the fuel-theft racket, which has cost the government billions of dollars a year and has been the target of a weekslong crackdown by the administration of Mexico\u2019s new president, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador.\nThe government\u2019s strategy has included diverting fuel from the pipelines most heavily targeted by criminal gangs, and transporting it by truck. But the logistical changes have slowed deliveries across the country, causing shortages and long lines at service stations.\nImage\nOne of those wounded by the blast \u2014 there were at least 74 \u2014 being transferred to a helicopter. Villagers, including families, had gathered to scoop up fuel from the breach.\nCredit\nAlfredo Estrella/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images\nMr. L\u00f3pez Obrador, who visited the area early Saturday, insisted that the disaster showed why his strategy was more necessary than ever: Fuel theft not only inflicts financial damage on the nation, but it also exacts a deadly toll.\n\u201cWe have to continue with the plan to end fuel theft,\u201d Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador said during a news conference later at the presidential palace in Mexico City. \u201cWe will not stop. We will eradicate this.\u201d\nThe fuel theft crisis is an early test of Mr. L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s efforts to combat the country\u2019s worsening security landscape. He has said he intends to both strengthen the nation\u2019s security apparatus and address underlying social issues, such as inequality and poverty.\nLast Wednesday, the lower house of Mexico\u2019s Congress approved the creation of a 60,000-member national guard composed of police officers and military personnel to handle the nation\u2019s public security tasks, including its fight against organized crime. The proposal has been widely criticized by opposition parties and human rights activists who say it represents a further militarization of policing.\nFriday\u2019s explosion, which occurred in a rural, impoverished part of the state of Hidalgo, was particularly deadly because the breach in the pipeline created by criminals had also lured hundreds of villagers from the municipality of Tlahuelilpan, drawn by the promise of free gasoline.\nThat section of pipeline had been among the parts of the fuel transportation network that had been temporarily shut as part of the government\u2019s strategy to curb theft. But the flow through the tube resumed on Friday, just hours before thieves punctured it, officials said.\nImage\nA forensic technician works at the site of the pipeline explosion.\nCredit\nHenry Romero/Reuters\nGov. Omar Fayad of Hidalgo told reporters that his state, like others, had suffered fuel shortages as a result of the government\u2019s strategy.\nResidents who gathered at the explosion site on Saturday said that while opportunism had prompted some residents to flock to the illegal pipeline tap on Friday, many others were compelled by the shortages created by the government crackdown.\nVillagers, they said, were desperate to find gas for their personal use.\n\u201cIf there hadn\u2019t been such a bad shortage, this tragedy would not have happened and innocent people would not have died,\u201d said Ra\u00fal Linares, 30, a farmer. \u201cPeople didn\u2019t have a way to move around, get to their jobs, go anywhere.\u201d\nImage\nA forensic expert with burned remains on a stretcher. Videos and photographs circulating on social media showed people engulfed in flames running away from the blaze and victims screaming for help after the explosion on Friday.\nCredit\nAlfredo Estrella/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images\nHe added: \u201cWe agree with fighting fuel theft, but not this way because it is us who ultimately paid the price.\u201d Mr. Linares said one of his nephews was badly burned in the explosion and another was missing.\nVideos taken before the blast showed a raucous atmosphere at the site, with villagers from Tlahuelilpan, including families, laughing as they filled plastic jugs, pails and canisters with the gasoline, which gushed from the break like a geyser.\nIn the footage, military personnel who had rushed to the scene can be seen standing by and observing the throng that had converged on the pipeline, which connects to the nearby Tula refinery operated by the government-run oil firm Petr\u00f3leos Mexicanos, known as Pemex.\nImage\nVillagers arguing with the military to allow them to search for their missing relatives.\nCredit\nHector Vivas/Getty Images\nMexico\u2019s defense secretary, Luis Cresencio Sandoval, said that about 25 troops were on the scene, but the contingent was not large enough to turn back the 600 to 800 villagers who had swarmed the site. He said that his troops tried to persuade residents to retreat but their entreaties were ignored, and some of the people turned \u201caggressive\u201d toward the soldiers.\nAbout two hours after the authorities learned of the break, the fuel ignited, causing a huge explosion and sending flames and clouds of smoke into the sky. Videos and photographs circulating on social media and broadcast on Mexican news channels showed people engulfed in fire running away from the blaze and victims screaming in pain and wailing for help.\nThe fire took more than four hours to extinguish and left a blackened scar in the landscape.\nIt was the deadliest pipeline explosion in Mexico in recent memory. In 2010, at least 27 people were killed, scores injured and numerous homes destroyed in a blast in San Mart\u00edn Texmelucan de Labastida, a city in the state of Puebla. That, too, was caused by an illegal siphoning effort, officials said.\nImage\nFirefighters work to extinguish the blaze in Hidalgo State in Mexico on Friday night.\nCredit\nFrancisco Villeda/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images\nOn Saturday afternoon, forensic investigators and military police officers were examining the scene as scores of residents watched. Some villagers said they hoped to glean information about missing relatives.\n\u201cWe are all mourning today,\u201d said Angela Perez, 54, two of whose neighbors were among the dead. Ms. Perez theorized that many villagers who had flocked to the pipeline rupture wanted to get gasoline to resell.\n\u201cBut it was a foolish mistake,\u201d she said. \u201cLook what happened.\u201d\nFuel theft has been a longstanding problem in Mexico that, until recent years, was mostly written off by the government as a business cost, analysts said. But the problem began to worsen about a decade ago as organized crime groups started to diversify their portfolios.\nImage\nVillagers in Tlahuelipan tried to identify the bodies of people killed. The promise of free gasoline had drawn scores of residents to the breach in the pipeline.\nCredit\nHector Vivas/Getty Images\nRising international fuel prices made the crime increasingly attractive. The crime groups co-opted officials at all levels of government using bribery and violence, and won support among impoverished local populations with a steady supply of low-cost, black-market fuel and offers of relatively lucrative employment as lookouts and fuel couriers.\nMuch of the theft occurs through taps drilled under the cover of darkness into pipelines that carry fuel from the nation\u2019s ports and refineries to distribution centers across the country. Though much of the pipeline system runs underground, thieves operating in remote regions and doing quick work with shovels have been easily able to unearth the pipes. They have generally used high-powered drills to perforate the pipes, installing taps to siphon the fuel.\nThe problem has worsened in recent years. During the first 10 months of last year, the authorities discovered more than 12,500 illegal taps \u2014 nearly double the number discovered in all of 2016 and more than 27 times the number a decade ago.\nIn a news conference on Saturday morning, Octavio Romero, the general director of Pemex, said that in the past three months, thieves had drilled at least 10 holes in the same pipeline that exploded on Friday, also causing fires.\n\u201cOil theft does not only gravely affect our country\u2019s economy,\u201d Governor Fayad said in a statement to The New York Times. \u201cToday the state of Hidalgo is crying because of this tragedy, which has taken so many people\u2019s lives. Such regrettable events should never happen again in Mexico.\u201d\nHe said the death toll could climb even higher.\n\u201cMany of the gravely wounded are battling between life and death,\u201d Governor Fayad said.\nThe governor also appealed to the public to help the authorities curb the fuel-theft epidemic, calling on Mexicans \u201cto help us fight this widespread phenomenon and to stay away from pipelines that have been seized or ruptured.\u201d\nMr. L\u00f3pez Obrador, who took office on Dec. 1, said about $3.14 billion in fuel had been drained from the system last year and sold on the black market. As part of the crackdown, he has deployed about 4,000 military and police personnel to guard the nation\u2019s fuel infrastructure.", "html": "<html>\n <body>\n  <div class=\"css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn\">\n   <div class=\"css-4w7y5l\">\n    <p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">\n     <html>\n      <body>\n       <p>\n        TLAHUELILPAN,\n        <span class=\"pos-link\">\n         Mexico\n        </span>\n        \u2014\n        <span class=\"pos-link\">\n         Mexico\n        </span>\n        \u2019s president vowed on Saturday to redouble his fight against an epidemic of fuel theft after thieves punctured a pipeline north of\n        <span class=\"pos-link\">\n         Mexico\n        </span>\n        City,\n       </p>\n      </body>\n     </html>\n     <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/18/world/americas/mexico-gas-pipeline-explosion.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">\n      causing an explosion that killed at least 73 people\n     </a>\n     and injured 74 others.\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">\n     <html>\n      <body>\n       <p>\n        The blast underscored the deadly perils of the fuel-theft racket, which has cost the government billions of dollars a year and has been the target of a weekslong crackdown by the administration of\n        <span class=\"pos-link\">\n         Mexico\n        </span>\n        \u2019s new president, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador.\n       </p>\n      </body>\n     </html>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">\n     The government\u2019s strategy has included diverting fuel from the pipelines most heavily targeted by criminal gangs, and transporting it by truck.

Order!\u201d in that undrownoutable voice, something like an air-raid siren with postnasal drip.\nHe doled out his pompous, antiquarian insults, cheerfully rebuking one member for \u201cchuntering from a sedentary position ineloquently and for no obvious purpose.\u201d\nThe outside world rarely takes much notice of the speaker of the House of Commons, a nonpartisan and typically low-profile figure who presides over parliamentary debates. But Britain\u2019s last-minute paralysis over exiting the European Union, or Brexit, has made Mr. Bercow into a kind of celebrity.\nWith less than 10 weeks left before the country is set to leave the bloc, he has broken precedent by wresting some control over the Brexit decision-making from Prime Minister Theresa May, allowing Parliament to act to stop the country from leaving without a deal.\nThis has won him the admiration of Europeans \u2014 a French radio station named him \u201cEuropean of the Week.\u201d Clips of his signature cry, \u201cOrder, Order!,\u201d have gone viral on social media.\nBut it infuriated Mrs. May\u2019s team, which on Friday threatened Mr. Bercow with the most supercilious of punishments: blocking his entry to the House of Lords \u2014 an honor bestowed on every speaker for more than 200 years.\nImage\nThe son of a cab driver from North London, Mr. Bercow propelled himself through the Oxbridge-educated upper reaches of British society by sheer determination and is viewed, variously, as a sharp-elbowed bully and a champion of the rights of Parliament.\nCredit\nAndy Rain/EPA, via Shutterstock\nIt is an extraordinary moment for Mr. Bercow, the 56-year-old son of a cabdriver from North London. An outsider sometimes mocked for his short stature (he is 5 foot 6\u00bd), he propelled himself through the Oxbridge-educated upper reaches of British society by sheer determination and is viewed, variously, as a sharp-elbowed bully and a champion of the rights of Parliament.\nThose personal qualities have come into play at a pivotal moment as Britain hurtles toward its March 29 exit with a government in stalemate.\n\u201cHe is a law unto himself,\u201d said Bobby Friedman, the author of a biography of Mr. Bercow, recalling the speaker\u2019s decision on Jan. 9 to allow Parliament to amend a government business motion on Brexit. Business motions give the executive power to determine what happens in Parliament and when, and have not been considered changeable by Parliament.\n\u201cFrom a political geek\u2019s point of view, it was pretty astonishing,\u201d Mr. Friedman said of Mr. Bercow\u2019s decision. \u201cHe said, \u2018I\u2019ll do what I like.\u2019 If anyone else was speaker, it would have been incredibly surprising. With him, not particularly.\"\nEven in the hyper-loquacious environment of British politics, Mr. Bercow stands out for his love of ornate language and withering insult.\n\u201cHe could never say, \u2018It\u2019s great to see you\u2019 \u201d; instead he would say, \u2018It gives me inestimable pleasure to meet you for the finest condiments created by Mrs. Twinings,\u2019 \u201d a colleague told Mr. Friedman, his biographer. A sitting lawmaker told The New York Times in 2013, \u201cIt\u2019s as if he goes to bed every night, reads a thesaurus, inwardly digests it and then spews it out the next day.\u201d\nOccasionally, when a fellow politician was speaking, he would cry out, \u201cSplit infinitive!\u201d\nMr. Bercow has made a career out of annoying his conservative colleagues. Some are still seething over his decision not to wear the traditional speaker\u2019s regalia, including wig and knee-breeches, which he said created \u201ca barrier between Parliament and the public.\u201d\nImage\nMr. Bercow and his wife, Sally, a Labour Party activist, at Wimbledon in 2017.\nCredit\nShaun Botterill/Getty Images\nBut nothing has approached the fury that followed his decision to allow lawmakers to amend a business motion \u2014 effectively curbing the government\u2019s powers.\nThe British speaker, unlike his American counterpart, is required to drop his party affiliation and remain neutral on matters of policy.\nCrispin Blunt, a lawmaker from the conservative Tory party, protested that Mr. Bercow could no longer claim to be a neutral arbiter on the issue of Brexit and should step down. Another Tory, David Morris, complained that Mr. Bercow had displayed a bumper sticker with an anatomical epithet relating to Brexit.\n\u201cMr. Bercow denies claims that his car displays a sticker, saying the vehicle belongs to his wife,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut it may as well be stuck firmly to his puffed-up chest on this occasion.\u201d\nMr. Bercow said he voted in 2016 to remain in the European Union, but insisted that he was not taking sides on the issue now. Instead, he said he was standing up for the right of Parliament to challenge a bullying executive.\n\u201cI understand the importance of precedent, but precedent does not completely bind, for one very simple reason,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we were guided only by precedent, manifestly nothing in our procedures would ever change. Things do change.\u201d\nMr. Bercow would not comment for this article.\nIan Dunt, a political commentator who opposes Brexit, said the government has sidelined Parliament throughout the process, claiming that the referendum had provided the executive with a more direct form of sovereignty.\nImage\nWith less than 10 weeks left before the country will leave the European Union, Mr. Bercow has broken precedent to let Parliament wrest some control over the process from Prime Minister Theresa May.\nCredit\nJack Taylor/Getty Images\nHe compared this moment to 1642, when King Charles strode into the House of Commons and demanded that five lawmakers be arrested for treason. The speaker at the time, William Lenthall, refused his orders, telling the king in a famous speech that he acted solely on behalf of the House of Commons.\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing now is one of these big moments of constitutional change,\u201d Mr. Dunt said. \u201cWhen you start thinking about the scale, you do start thinking about the English Civil War.\u201d\nMr. Bercow is the grandson of Jack Bercowitch, who emigrated from Romania to the East End of London at the age of 16. His father, Charlie, ran a used-car business, and then, when it was forced to close, drove a cab.\nFriends and neighbors described John as an opinionated boy who occasionally irritated his grade schoolteachers by contradicting them in class, wrote Mr. Friedman in the biography \u201cBercow, Mr. Speaker.\u201d\n\u201cHe spoke like a politician at the age of 10,\u201d said Ashley Fuller, a tennis partner. \u201cHe\u2019d come in and see my father and say, \u2018Mr. Fuller, have you heard what\u2019s in The Times on page 3? It\u2019s outrageous, I have to show you.\u2019\u201d\nHis precociousness and small stature did not ingratiate him to schoolyard bullies. Mr. Friedman said they threw him into a pond, laughing and saying, \u201cBercow can be in there with the other amphibians.\u201d In university, \u201cwe\u2019d quote Monty Python and he\u2019d quote\u201d the 19th-century Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli, Andrew Crosbie, a fellow Tory activist, told Mr. Friedman.\nHe found his tribe in politics, a profession where his verbosity was an asset.\nAs a young man, he aligned himself with the far-right wing of the Conservative Party, at one point promoting the \u201cassisted repatriation\u201d of immigrants, an odd position for the grandson of Jewish immigrants.\nImage\nMr. Bercow in his office at The House of Commons in London in 2013.\nCredit\nLynsey Addario for The New York Times\nA fellow activist from that era recalled him memorizing and reciting whole speeches by Enoch Powell, a Tory lawmaker widely accused of inciting racism. Later in life, Mr. Bercow distanced himself from that movement, calling his own views at the time \u201cbone-headed.\u201d\nMr. Bercow scrapped his way up. He was so intent on entering Parliament that he hired a helicopter so that he could attend candidate selection meetings \u2014 typically sleepy, provincial affairs \u2014 in two constituencies on the same night.\nIn 2009, he became speaker of the House of Commons \u2014 the first Jewish lawmaker ever to hold that post. He resigned from the party, as is customary, when he became speaker. His politics had migrated to the left; he was married to a Labour activist, Sally, and many of his own party members spoke of him with open loathing.\nDavid Cameron, then the prime minister, once mocked Mr. Bercow in front of a crowd of journalists, joking that, at the upcoming royal wedding, the speaker would intervene by yelling, \u201cOrder! I want to hear what the prince is saying.\u201d\nHe lampooned Mr. Bercow\u2019s height by likening him to one of the seven dwarves, recounting an exchange in which the speaker declared, \u201cI\u2019m not happy!\u201d and a junior health minister replied, \u201cWell, which one are you?\u201d\nInsults became a central mode of communication between the speaker and the Tories.\nThe health minister called Mr. Bercow a \u201cstupid, sanctimonious dwarf.\u201d Another government minister, Andrea Leadsom, asked to nominate candidates for the \u201cbest villain\u201d of the political year, described \u201can incredibly annoying little creature that squeaks a lot and has found a place in the corridor outside my office.\u201d She then hastened to add that she was referring to a mouse, not Mr. Bercow.\nMr. Bercow, meanwhile, sneered at Mr. Cameron for his privileged background, remarking that \u201cEton, hunting, shooting and lunch at White\u2019s,\u201d an exclusive St. James\u2019s gentleman\u2019s club, did not qualify him to lead.\nMr. Bercow is said to have a temper and has been accused of bullying his staff, something he denies. An independent inquiry last fall suggested that he should step down. He has signaled that he will leave his post this year.\nThe events of the last week have won him praise from unusual quarters. The Times of London, calling him \u201chardly a sympathetic individual,\u201d wrote approvingly of his actions, saying the government\u2019s treatment of Parliament \u201chas appeared drawn from the 17th century, frequently invoking the will of the people, much as the early Stuarts used to assert the divine right of kings.\u201d\nAs for Mr. Bercow, he does not pay much attention to his critics, he told The House Magazine in 2012.\n\u201cThey scribble away and the world goes on,\u201d he said. \u201cI have no plans to die tomorrow but if I die tomorrow I will die a very happy man.\u201d", "html": "<html>\n <body>\n  <div class=\"css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn\">\n   <div class=\"css-4w7y5l\">\n    <p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">\n     LONDON \u2014 In the wretched purgatory that was Westminster last week, there was precisely one person who seemed to be having fun.\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">\n     From the silk-canopied speaker\u2019s chair of the House of Commons, John Bercow looked out over Britain\u2019s squabbling Parliament and brayed, \u201cOrder!

The headline on Wednesday: \u201cWe will not forgive you for this death! Politicians!\u201d\nIn Gdansk, which like many cities remains a bastion of the opposition, most people place the blame for the current climate at the feet of one party, Law and Justice, and its leader, Jaroslaw Kaczynski.\nThe night before the funeral, Krzysztof Szczepaniak, a professor at the University of Gdansk, was one of thousands who stood in line outside of the majestic Basilica of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary, which dates to the 14th century, waiting to pay his respects to the city\u2019s slain leader.\nWith his wife and their 8-year-old twins, he was still waiting in the biting cold as midnight approached.\nThough it was a moment for quiet reflection, he said, he could not contain his anger at what he said was the contempt shown by the governing party since the killing.\nImage\nMr. Adamowicz was the frequent target of right-wing politicians and journalists, who portrayed him as an immoral criminal who would let terrorists into Poland.\nCredit\nSean Gallup/Getty Images\n\u201cThey do not feel sorry; they are sowers of hatred,\u201d Mr. Szczepaniak said. \u201cWe hope very much that after this murderous murder, the Polish nation will finally understand which side the truth is on. And again we can be proud of Poland and our solidarity, as we were in 1989.\u201d\nThat was the year Poland broke free from communist rule. The spark in the fight for freedom came from this city, where the labor unions of the shipyards banded together in a movement that became known as Solidarity, or Solidarnosc in Polish.\nBut the roots of today\u2019s current political divide can also be found in those days of uprising.\nMr. Kaczynski, along with his twin brother, Lech, fought alongside Lech Walesa to bring down Communism. In 1990, he helped the Solidarity hero win the presidency and later served as Mr. Walesa\u2019s chief of staff. But they fell out after an intense power struggle and have been enemies ever since.\nMr. Kaczynski soon came to believe that the revolution had never been completed. By agreeing to a bloodless transition that allowed some Communist figures to remain in public life, he believed political leaders had failed to eradicate the Soviet infection.\nHe formed Center Agreement and, ultimately, Law and Justice, which had a brief turn in power from 2005 until 2007. But much of his agenda had been stymied by the courts. The party lost the early election to the liberal Civic Platform.\nImage\nThe killing of Mr. Adamowicz has left many wondering whether the prevalence of hate speech in politics is to blame.\nCredit\nWojtek Radwanski/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images\nWhile his party sought to make a comeback, tragedy struck in 2010: A plane carrying dozens of the country\u2019s top political and military leaders crashed near the Russian city of Smolensk. Everyone on board was killed, including Lech Kaczynski, who was president of Poland at the time.\nFor a brief moment, the nation came together. But soon, the tragedy was seized upon by Jaroslaw Kaczynski, who placed it at the center of the party\u2019s mythology of martyrdom and aggrieved nationalism.\nNow, instead of evoking a national tragedy, the word Smolensk is a marker of tribal identity.\nMr. Dudek, the conservative political scientist, said, \u201cI have friends, highly intelligent and very-well-educated folks, who sincerely wish Kaczynski\u2019s death.\u201d\nHe said the state television network, TVP, firmly under the control of the ruling party, is the lead promoter of bile with its coverage of the killing and the current climate; it has laid blame for the latter at the feet of opposition lawmakers.\nThousands of protesters rallied outside TVP\u2019s headquarters in Warsaw on Thursday night, calling for its director to be fired and \u201cto stop the propaganda of hate.\u201d\nImage\nScouts standing at an urn before Mr. Adamowicz\u2019s funeral.\nCredit\nSean Gallup/Getty Images\nThe broadcaster has since toned down its coverage, but Mr. Kaczynski has refused calls to remove the director.\nEven if the killing of Mr. Adamowicz proves to be the irrational act of madman, there is fear that the increasingly heated rhetoric could translate to violence.\nSince Monday, the police have detained nearly two dozen people who had either promoted violence or had threatened public figures. A special team of 105 prosecutors has been established to investigate hate crimes.\nThe mayor of Gdansk had been the frequent target of right-wing politicians and journalists, who portrayed him as an immoral criminal who would let terrorists into Poland and represented a threat to the nation.\nMr. Adamowicz, who was first elected mayor in 1998, dedicated himself to combating what he saw as the forces of hate and intolerance. During an interview at his office last spring, he said it was his goal to show the world that the Poland of Mr. Kaczynski was not the only Poland.\nImage\nA memorial for Mr. Adamowicz in Gdansk. Across the country on Saturday, in cities like Warsaw and Poznan, there were public gatherings and an outpouring of grief.\nCredit\nSean Gallup/Getty Images\nHis city, he said, was a place of tolerance, where immigrants were welcomed and gays and lesbians did not need to feel threatened, and it still embraced the values at the foundation of liberal democracy.\nAt the funeral, political leaders from other cities vowed to carry on with his agenda.\n\u201cWe, the mayors of Polish cities, promise you to build a Poland that will be truly democratic and European, just like your Gdansk,\u201d Jacek Karnowski, the mayor of the nearby resort town of Sopot, told the crowd.\nAcross the country on Saturday, in cities like Warsaw and Poznan, there were public gatherings and an outpouring of grief. Families filled the streets of Gdansk, many carrying the red flag of the city adorned with a black ribbon, and words and music from the funeral Mass echoed through the warren of streets and alleys.\nThe archbishop of Gdansk, Slawoj Leszek Glodz, told the crowd it was time for civility to return to public life.\n\u201cWe need to rid Polish politics and public life of the language hatred, condescension and humiliation,\u201d he said.", "html": "<html>\n <body>\n  <div class=\"css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn\">\n   <div class=\"css-4w7y5l\">\n    <p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">\n     <html>\n      <body>\n       <p>\n        GDANSK,\n        <span class=\"pos-link\">\n         Poland\n        </span>\n        \u2014 In a bitterly divided\n        <span class=\"pos-link\">\n         Poland\n        </span>\n        , residents of the port city of Gdansk were united: in grief over the assassination of their mayor, in anger over the toxic political climate that his killing has laid bare and in solidarity that it is time for a change in the country.\n       </p>\n      </body>\n     </html>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">\n     Even before the mayor, Pawel Adamowicz, 53, was laid to rest on Saturday, with thousands filling the cobblestone streets around the ancient brick church in the heart of the old city, it was clear that his death could have profound political consequences as voters prepared for national elections this fall.\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">\n     <html>\n      <body>\n       <p>\n        The contest is viewed by many as the most consequential in the young history of\n        <span class=\"pos-link\">\n         Poland\n        </span>\n        \u2019s Third Republic.\n       </p>\n      </body>\n     </html>\n    </p>\n   </div>\n   <aside class=\"css-1m2ozyi\">\n    <span>\n    </span>\n   </aside>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn\">\n   <div class=\"css-4w7y5l\">\n    <p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">\n     <html>\n      <body>\n       <p>\n        \u201cThe polarization in\n        <span class=\"pos-link\">\n         Poland\n        </span>\n        is absolutely horrifying,\u201d said Antoni Dudek, a conservative political scientist at Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski University in Warsaw.

But as the tourist numbers decline, and the frustration and trepidation rises in Rosarito and other tourist-dependent areas in Baja California, some local residents have begun to angrily blame the migrant caravan.\n\u201cThey came here with an arrogant attitude, demanding things, and abused the help we offered them, arguing they are fleeing violence or poverty, but we all are poor!\u201d said Jorge Medina, a manager of the Bombay Beach nightclub in Rosarito.\nHe said his business had plummeted by almost 80 percent in the past two months.\nImage\nCamel rides are one of the many quirky tourist activities offered in Rosarito.\nCredit\nMeghan Dhaliwal for The New York Times\n\u201cLife is not easy for us either,\u201d Mr. Medina added. \u201cWe have our own set of problems, including violence, and it is unfair that our lives are disrupted because of them.\u201d\nMr. Medina said he agreed with the harsher measures taken by the United States government to deter migrants, including the use of tear gas at the border, and President Trump\u2019s resolution to build an enhanced security wall.\nMr. Argiles, along with other hotel owners, is trying to send out a positive message through social media campaigns that Rosarito is ready and eager to welcome back tourists.\n\u201cWe have to recover from this,\u201d he said.\nGovernment data, not always reliable, points to only a 4 percent decrease in overall room occupancy in Rosarito last month compared with the same month in 2017, and local officials argued that the recent drop in visitors cannot be single-handedly explained by immigration-related issues.\nBut with the Trump administration\u2019s increasingly hostile anti-immigration narrative, officials are worried of longer-term economic losses.\nImage\nThe empty pool area of the Rosarito Beach Hotel, whose room occupancy has fallen sharply.\nCredit\nMeghan Dhaliwal for The New York Times\n\u201cIt definitely does not contribute to an ideal environment for tourism, and our economy heavily depends on it,\u201d said Ives Lelevier, the under secretary of tourism for the state of Baja California.\nAbel Ortega, the owner of Villa Ortega\u2019s restaurant in Puerto Nuevo, a community just to the south of Rosarito better known as \u201cLobster Village,\u201d remembered when the line of eager patrons would go around the building, and his wait staff couldn\u2019t keep up with the demand for deep-fried lobsters and margaritas.\nLast year at this time, Mr. Ortega said he averaged 20 reservations a day but is down to two or three.\nHe looked outside where a worker was desperately trying to court the few passers-by to step inside. \u201cIt\u2019s like a ghost town now,\u201d Mr. Ortega said.\nImage\nThe forlorn beach in Rosarito.\nCredit\nMeghan Dhaliwal for The New York Times", "html": "<html>\n <body>\n  <div class=\"css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn\">\n   <div class=\"css-4w7y5l\">\n    <p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">\n     <html>\n      <body>\n       <p>\n        ROSARITO,\n        <span class=\"pos-link\">\n         Mexico\n        </span>\n        \u2014 On a forlorn beach, a long line of riderless horses shuffled along, their wrangler unable to spot a single sightseer who might want to hop on.\n       </p>\n      </body>\n     </html>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">\n     The vendors selling fruit and candy, or touting massages and tattoos, had relinquished their efforts to find customers and instead sprawled on the sand.\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">\n     Inside the landmark Rosarito Beach Hotel, only the backdrop sound of the ocean waves interrupted the silence.\n    </p>\n   </div>\n   <aside class=\"css-1m2ozyi\">\n    <span>\n    </span>\n   </aside>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn\">\n   <div class=\"css-4w7y5l\">\n    <p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">\n     <html>\n      <body>\n       <p>\n        The tourist town of Rosarito,\n        <span class=\"pos-link\">\n         Mexico\n        </span>\n        , usually bustling with throngs of young Americans partying at crowded dance clubs, was desolate.

Her party had lost in key local elections, imperiling her run for a second term next year.\nBut then she got help from an unlikely source: the president of China.\nIn a speech this month to the people of Taiwan, a self-ruled democracy that Beijing considers Chinese territory, President Xi Jinping said the island \u201cmust be and will be\u201d united with China and warned that independence efforts could be met by armed force.\nMr. Xi\u2019s speech raised anxieties in Taiwan that Ms. Tsai was able to tap into by delivering a rebuke of Mr. Xi\u2019s proposal, in a rare departure from her usual cautious ambiguity.\n\u201cDemocratic values are the values and way of life that Taiwanese cherish,\u201d she said, \u201cand we call upon China to bravely move toward democracy.\u201d\nMs. Tsai\u2019s approval ratings surged after her speech, according to Taiwanese news reports. She also appeared to reassert her influence within her party with the appointment of an ally, Cho Jung-tai, as chairman this month.\nThe revitalization of Ms. Tsai\u2019s political prospects highlights the challenge that the increasingly authoritarian government in Beijing faces in offering a political formula for unification that would be attractive to Taiwan\u2019s vigorous democracy.\nMost of Taiwan\u2019s 23 million people are in favor of maintaining the island\u2019s de facto independence without taking any formal moves that might bring a military response from China. Still, Taiwan has tended to push back against threats from Beijing.\nMs. Tsai\u2019s response \u201clooked very presidential\u201d to many Taiwanese, said Hans H. Tung, an associate professor of political science at National Taiwan University. He said it also earned Ms. Tsai greater support from her Democratic Progressive Party, which leans toward independence.\nIt was a notable turnaround after Ms. Tsai\u2019s party lost several crucial mayoral elections in November to the opposition party, the Kuomintang, or K.M.T., largely because of unhappiness with how her government has handled economic issues.\nThe losses led Ms. Tsai to resign as party chairwoman, making her less certain to be the party\u2019s candidate in the presidential election next year.\nImage\nA television in New Taipei City showing Mr. Xi giving a speech earlier this month. He said that Taiwan \u201cmust\u201d be united with China and that independence efforts could be met by armed force.\nCredit\nSam Yeh/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images\nBut Ms. Tsai\u2019s firm rejection of Mr. Xi\u2019s speech has earned her the support of voters like Li Imte, a resident of Taipei. Ms. Li said she had until recently been disappointed with Ms. Tsai\u2019s unwillingness to prioritize same-sex marriage, an issue she had campaigned on before she was elected in 2016.\n\u201cIn terms of changing Taiwan\u2019s situation for the better, I really can\u2019t think of anyone out there more capable than Tsai Ing-wen,\u201d Ms. Li said.\nExpressions of encouragement for Ms. Tsai have flooded Taiwanese social media, with one viral post portraying her as a mother defending her child from a bully. Hundreds of female doctors from across Taiwan took out a front-page advertisement in two local newspapers urging readers to support Ms. Tsai.\nIn a joint declaration last week, representatives of Taiwan\u2019s aboriginal peoples also challenged Mr. Xi\u2019s assertion that Taiwan is part of China.\n\u201cTaiwan is the sacred land where generations of our ancestors lived and protected with their lives,\u201d their letter read. \u201cIt has never belonged to China.\u201d\nMr. Xi\u2019s speech also helped Ms. Tsai by dealing a blow to the opposition Kuomintang, which favors closer ties with China and is Beijing\u2019s preferred dialogue partner.\nAt the heart of the Taiwan dispute is the so-called 1992 Consensus, an unwritten agreement between Beijing and the Kuomintang government that monopolized political power in Taiwan at that time. That agreement holds that there is only one China, which includes Taiwan, but that both sides can define \u201cOne China\u201d in their own way.\nFor Beijing, that means the People\u2019s Republic of China. For the Kuomintang it is the Republic of China, Taiwan\u2019s official name.\nMs. Tsai has refused to endorse the 1992 Consensus at all, leading Mr. Xi\u2019s administration to suspend official contacts with her government.\nIn his speech, Mr. Xi also said that in the event of peaceful unification Taiwan would be administered under the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d political model China uses to govern Hong Kong, a territory where there are concerns about shrinking freedoms under Mr. Xi\u2019s rule.\nAnalysts say Ms. Tsai skillfully used Mr. Xi\u2019s speech to equate the 1992 Consensus with Beijing\u2019s \u201cone country, two systems\u201d formula. That has put the Kuomintang on the defensive over its support for the 1992 Consensus.\nImage\nThe changing of the guard at Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall in Taipei. Mr. Chiang\u2019s party, the Kuomintang, which favors closer ties with China, has been on the defensive over Mr. Xi\u2019s speech.\nCredit\nIsaac Lawrence for The New York Times\n\u201cThe K.M.T. doesn\u2019t want to be tagged as defending Xi\u2019s mode for unification that has led to the erosion of freedoms in Hong Kong,\u201d said Bonnie Glaser, director of the China Power Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.\nThe \u201cone country, two systems\u201d arrangement has been used in Hong Kong since it was returned from British colonial control in 1997. The model provides the territory with some autonomy from Beijing, allowing Hong Kong residents more freedom than citizens in the rest of China. But the space for pro-democratic activism and freedom of expression has shrunk in recent years.\nIn China, Ma Xiaoguang, a spokesman for the Taiwan Affairs Office, said Wednesday that the 1992 Consensus and the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d model were not the same thing. \u201cThe leadership of the D.P.P. has mixed up these two purposefully to misguide the Taiwanese people,\u201d Mr. Ma said, referring to Ms. Tsai\u2019s party.\nZhu Songling, director of the Institute of Taiwan Studies at Beijing Union University, said that a \u201cone country, two systems\u201d arrangement for Taiwan would not have to replicate the one in Hong Kong.\n\u201cThe \u2018two systems\u2019 for Taiwan can be negotiated,\u201d Professor Zhu said. \u201cHow do you know that \u2018one country, two systems\u2019 does not suit Taiwan even before starting a negotiation?\u201d\nBut Ms. Tsai\u2019s rejection of \u201cone country, two systems\u201d appears to have support in Taiwan that stretches across party lines. The Kuomintang\u2019s chairman, Wu Den-yih, said in a speech last week to party members that the 1992 Consensus was \u201cunrelated\u201d to the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d model proposed by Mr. Xi.\nWayne Chiang, a Kuomintang legislator whose great-grandfather, Chiang Kai-shek, was the longtime president of the Republic of China, praised Ms. Tsai\u2019s emphasis on the need for Beijing to respect Taiwan\u2019s democracy and freedom. For that, Mr. Chiang was criticized by fellow members of the party and its supporters.\nMr. Chiang also dismissed Mr. Xi\u2019s proposal. \u201cTaiwan is not Hong Kong,\u201d he told reporters last week. \u201cThe majority of Taiwanese people also find it impossible to accept \u2018one country, two systems.\u2019\u201d\nAnother Kuomintang legislator, Jason Hsu, went even further, saying in an interview that Mr. Xi\u2019s speech showed that the 1992 Consensus was no longer viable for his party as an approach to relations with China and that the Kuomintang needed to think of a new strategy.\nIt is unclear if the current wave of support for Ms. Tsai will improve her chances at re-election, given that it changes little about the domestic challenges she still faces.\n\u201cThe question is whether the boost in Tsai support will be only temporary,\u201d Ms. Glaser said.\nBut she noted that China\u2019s threats against Taiwan tended to benefit the party that is more critical of Beijing.\n\u201cThe people want a government that can protect them from outside threats when they feel insecure,\u201d she said.", "html": "<html>\n <body>\n  <div class=\"css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn\">\n   <div class=\"css-4w7y5l\">\n    <p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">\n     <html>\n      <body>\n       <p>\n        TAIPEI,\n        <span class=\"pos-link\">\n         Taiwan\n        </span>\n        \u2014 Just a few weeks ago, President Tsai Ing-wen of\n        <span class=\"pos-link\">\n         Taiwan\n        </span>\n        was struggling politically.

Bolton, who left the country without meeting with Mr. Erdogan. Infuriated by comments Mr. Bolton had made in Israel that Turkey would be forced to ensure that Kurdish forces were protected, Mr. Erdogan canceled a proposed meeting.\nMr. Graham met with Mr. Erdogan for over two hours, and described it as a \u201cdirect and productive meeting\u201d on Friday. Then, on an impromptu invitation from the Turkish president, the senator joined him at a concert by the Turkish pianist Fazil Say, which he described as one of the best evenings of his life.\nTurkish officials have not commented on Mr. Graham\u2019s meeting in Ankara beyond confirming that they occurred. Defense Minister Hulusi Akar, who also met with Mr. Graham on Friday, said in a statement that the United States had not kept its promises to remove YPG forces from Manbij and promised that Turkey would continue to combat terrorism along its border.\nAs he prepared to depart on Saturday, Mr. Graham said there was a way to mitigate the worst fallout of a swift American withdrawal: \u201cThere is no excuse to play it poorly.\u201d\nContrary to Mr. Trump\u2019s declaration, the defeat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, had not been completely achieved yet, he added.\n\u201cIf you walk away, ISIS will come back and create a nightmare,\u201d Mr. Graham said in an interview. Turkey\u2019s strategic concerns had to be taken into account, and Iran kept from seizing Syria\u2019s oil fields, he added.\nHe said that Mr. Trump\u2019s plan for a withdrawal could be achieved, but with more time for planning. The 2,000 United States special forces troops in northeastern Syria could be withdrawn and replaced with a new mission and a smaller force to ensure the Islamic State did not resurface and prevent the Syrian government and Iranian forces from taking over the territory, he said.\nMr. Graham has long criticized the United States\u2019 policy of arming and training the Kurdish People\u2019s Protection Units in Syria, also known as Y.P.G., saying that it works against the interests of Turkey, which is a strategic ally of the United States and NATO. The Y.P.G. is affiliated with the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party in Turkey. The United States and Turkey have both designated that group a terrorist organization, saying that it works against the interests of Turkey, which is a strategic ally of the United States and NATO.\nTo withdraw and leave the Kurdish fighters with weapons supplied by the United States was \u201cinsane,\u201d the senator said.\nTurkey would be driven to take military action inside Syria, creating a broader war, he said. \u201cThat would be putting Turkey in a terrible spot,\u201d he said in an interview ahead of the briefing. \u201cThat can all be avoided if we slow this down.\u201d\nGen. Joseph F. Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has a plan, he added. American forces would maintain control of air space in eastern Syria, and other international forces could continue support for the Syrian Democratic Forces, which have been working with American forces to combat the Islamic State. Both France and Britain have units in Syria.\nMr. Graham said the most important step to prevent a broader war and a Turkish invasion was to ensure that the road map for the city of Manbij in northern Syria went ahead. Under that plan, Y.P.G. forces would withdraw and a local council acceptable to all sides, including Turkey, would take over the city\u2019s administration.\nThe United States could move away from what Mr. Trump has called the \u201cendless war\u201d but still meet national security objectives to \u201cprotect an ally from a problem it created,\u201d he said.\n\u201cYou can do all that with smaller forces, partnering with others,\u201d Mr. Graham added. \u201cIt would be a new mission, but the idea that Syria is not strategically important to the United States I completely reject.\u201d", "html": "<html>\n <body>\n  <div class=\"css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn\">\n   <div class=\"css-4w7y5l\">\n    <p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">\n     <html>\n      <body>\n       <p>\n        ANKARA, Turkey \u2014 After lengthy meetings with the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Senator Lindsey Graham called on Saturday for a slower, smarter withdrawal of American troops from\n        <span class=\"pos-link\">\n         Syria\n        </span>\n        to avoid setting off a broader war and a nightmare for Turkey.\n       </p>\n      </body>\n     </html>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">\n     <html>\n      <body>\n       <p>\n        Mr. Graham, Republican of South Carolina, has a long familiarity with\n        <span class=\"pos-link\">\n         Turkey\n        </span>\n        and its place in the NATO alliance, and he said he was on a mission to ensure that the American withdrawal\n       </p>\n      </body>\n     </html>\n     <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/19/us/politics/trump-syria-turkey-troop-withdrawal.html?action=click&amp;module=inline&amp;pgtype=Article&amp;region=Footer\" title=\"\">\n      announced by President Trump in December\n     </a>\n     <html>\n      <body>\n       <p>\n        did not cause greater damage that would be against\n        <span class=\"pos-link\">\n         United States\n        </span>\n        interests in the long run.\n       </p>\n      </body>\n     </html>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">\n     <html>\n      <body>\n       <p>\n        \u201cI can understand the desire to withdraw, but withdrawal without a plan is chaos,\u201d he told a news briefing in Ankara, the Turkish capital. \u201cIt would be\n        <span class=\"pos-link\">\n         Iraq\n        </span>\n        on steroids,\u201d he warned, in a reference to how the Islamic State gained power after the withdrawal of American forces from the country in 2011.\n       </p>\n      </body>\n     </html>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">\n     <html>\n      <body>\n       <p>\n        Mr. Graham\u2019s trip to\n        <span class=\"pos-link\">\n         Turkey\n        </span>\n        came after an aborted visit by the White House national security adviser, John R.

In London, women marched against punishing austerity measures.

Now, we are erecting walls and closing ports to ships that rescue migrants at sea,\u201d she told participants, referring to Italian policy under Interior Minister Matteo Salvini to no longer participate in sea rescues outside the maritime border and to bar ships carrying rescued migrants from docking.\nIn an interview, Ms. Palladino said women in Italy faced a difficult time. Violence is prevalent, and if women denounce their aggressors, she said, they do not get \u201csufficient protection.\u201d\nAlthough a report by Istat, the national statistic agency, said that 43 percent of working Italian women had been subjected to some form of harassment at least once during their life, the Me Too movement has not taken hold in Italy.\n\u201cMeToo was nonexistent in Italy because women were afraid of speaking out, and those who did were revictimized and condemned,\u201d said Luisa Betti Dakli, a journalist and one of the speakers.\nCarlo Cosenza of Sentinelli di Roma, an association that describes itself as \u201clay and anti-fascist,\u201d got one of the biggest cheers of the day when he held up a poster showing Mr. Salvini and Mr. Trump.\nImage\nA rally in Seville, Spain, this past week.\nCredit\nMarcelo Del Pozo/Reuters\n\u201cThese people are trying to build a future that is not open to all. Let\u2019s stop them now,\u201d he said.\nIn London, organizers chose \u201cWomen Demand Bread & Roses\u201d as a slogan this year to protest the government\u2019s squeeze on essential services. It drew inspiration from the American \u201cBread and Roses\u201d protests for working women\u2019s rights in the 1910s.\nThe march across the heart of London drew around 3,000 people. They held signs reading, \u201cMen of Quality Don\u2019t Fear Equality\u201d and \u201cBrexit Wrecks It,\u201d reflecting the political deadlock ahead of the March deadline for Britain to leave the European Union.\nIn Berlin, around 2,000 protesters marched from the Brandenburg Gate to the Alexanderplatz along the famous Unter den Linden. Organizers called for scrapping a Hitler-era law that makes it a crime for doctors to advertise that they perform abortions.\nMarchers in Frankfurt, Germany, met at two spots at 5 minutes to 12, in a reference to the urgency of women\u2019s issue. Roughly 1,200 people marched, according to the Frankfurt police, many wearing the pink knit hats emblematic of the movement.\nThey waved flag and held signs saying, \u201cTeach girls to be somebodies, instead of Somebody\u2019s,\u201d and others spoke of racism, gay rights and abortion issues. Members of Green and Social democratic parties showed up with party banners.\nMarches were scheduled for Sunday in cities such as Sydney, Australia, Taipei, Buenos Aires and later in the year elsewhere.\nWomen in Spain held rallies this past week that were independent of the Women\u2019s March movement but that denounced the return of the far-right in Spanish politics. On Tuesday, they protested against the right-wing coalition government taking office in Andalusia, led by the Popular Party but supported by Vox, a far-right party that secured its first parliamentary seats in elections last month.\nVox is nationalist and anti-immigrant, but has also angered women\u2019s associations because of its call for Spain to abolish its abortion law and to overhaul another law covering gender violence. Vox has also questioned official data about domestic violence and wants to unwind gay rights in a country that was among the first to allow same-sex marriage, in 2005.\nThe protests involved about 45 women\u2019s associations and took place in 50 cities. Protesters held signs that read, \u201cNot a step backward,\u201d in defense of abortion and other rights.", "html": "<html>\n <body>\n  <div class=\"css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn\">\n   <div class=\"css-4w7y5l\">\n    <p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">\n     ROME \u2014 Women of all ages, and some men, took to the streets in a dozen cities around the world on Saturday, the\n     <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/19/us/womens-march-2019.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">\n      anniversary\n     </a>\n     of the\n     <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/21/us/womens-march.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">\n      2017 Women\u2019s March\n     </a>\n     that served as a strong rebuke of President Trump\u2019s policies.\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">\n     <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://womensmarchglobal.org/events/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">\n      The annual marches and rallies\n     </a>\n     have taken on wider themes since then, such as challenging the rise of the far right, while also calling for an end to inequality, the gender pay gap and violence against women.\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">\n     <html>\n      <body>\n       <p>\n        Some events were organized in response to a call from the\n        <span class=\"pos-link\">\n         United States\n        </span>\n        to create a \u201cWomen\u2019s Wave.\u201d But others were held independently, and in many cases, the core message was that women\u2019s rights are about more than Mr. Trump.\n       </p>\n      </body>\n     </html>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">\n     <html>\n      <body>\n       <p>\n        In cities across the\n        <span class=\"pos-link\">\n         United States\n        </span>\n        , women braved subzero temperatures in some parts of the country to march even as\n       </p>\n      </body>\n     </html>\n     <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/23/us/womens-march-anti-semitism.html?action=click&amp;module=inline&amp;pgtype=Article&amp;region=Footer\" title=\"\">\n      accusations of anti-Semitism\n     </a>\n     have rocked the movement and prompted questions about its future.\n    </p>\n   </div>\n   <aside class=\"css-1m2ozyi\">\n    <span>\n    </span>\n   </aside>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn\">\n   <div class=\"css-4w7y5l\">\n    <p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">\n     [\n     <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/19/us/womens-march-2019.html?module=inline\">\n     </a>\n     <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/19/us/womens-march-2019.html\" title=\"\">\n      Read about the U.S. marches, underscored by divisions and celebrations.\n     </a>\n     ]\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">\n     <html>\n      <body>\n       <p>\n        The rallies in European countries like\n        <span class=\"pos-link\">\n         Germany\n        </span>\n        and Italy included warnings of bleak times because of the rise of populism and the far-right.

The files contain the names of 4,141 Latvians who supposedly informed on their fellow citizens.\nCredit\nAkos Stiller for The New York Times\nLatvia, one of three Baltic nations reborn as independent states in 1991, has been arguing for nearly three decades over what to do with the so-called Cheka bags, sacks and briefcases stuffed with secret files left behind by the K.G.B., the Soviet secret police agency originally known as the Cheka.\nOther former Soviet lands, like Lithuania, Estonia and Georgia, found some K.G.B. files after they broke free of Moscow. Germany quickly opened up files left by East Germany\u2019s Stasi secret police after reunification in 1990.\nBut only Latvia was left with a systematic index listing the real and code names of more than 4,000 purported agents, along with a large digital archive of K.G.B. activities known as Delta.\nSo instead of clearing the air, a vote by Latvia\u2019s Parliament that the contents of the bags be posted online has confronted the tiny Baltic nation with an unsettling question. Is it slowly coming to terms with the fact that its people were not just victims of Soviet oppression but, in some cases, also eager collaborators? Or has it fallen prey to a devious plot by the K.G.B. to sow disarray among the country\u2019s post-independence elites with fabricated records of betrayal?\nImage\nFor many Latvians. the appearance of their names, code names and dates of recruitment in a recently released K.G.B. archive has come as a traumatic surprise.\nCredit\nAkos Stiller for The New York Times\nThe latter view is widely held by those who have been outed as agents but insist they had never knowingly worked for the K.G.B. Instead, they say, they have been framed by Soviet secret police officers who padded their roster of informants, either to impress superiors or plant a slowly ticking time bomb under Latvia\u2019s future as an independent state.\n\u201cIt is impossible that the K.G.B. would leave behind a real list of agents in what it considered enemy territory,\u201d Mr. Tjarve said. The files, he said, must have been doctored and deliberately left as a \u201cspecial gift\u201d to Latvia, now a member of NATO, as part of a \u201cdisinformation operation\u201d by retreating Soviet officers.\nLatvians found \u201cin the bags,\u201d the term of art for people who have turned up in the files, include a two-time former prime minister, the chief justice of the Supreme Court, a onetime foreign minister, leaders of the Catholic and Orthodox churches, three post-independence rectors of the University of Latvia, celebrated filmmakers and assorted television stars and writers. Some names leaked years ago or appeared in a Latvian documentary, \u201cLustrum,\u201d released late last year.\nBut the publication of the full list has still caused dismay.\nMara Sprudja, director of the national archive, which began posting the files online in December and will release another batch in May, said she was particularly shocked, for example, to see the name of Andres Slapins, a Latvian cameraman, shot and killed by Soviet troops who attacked pro-independence activists in Riga, the capital, in 1991.\nFINLAND\nSWEDEN\nESTONIA\nRUSSIA\nRiga\nLATVIA\nKukas\nBaltic\nSea\nLITHUANIA\nRUSSIA\nBELARUS\nPOLAND\n100 MILES\nBy The New York Times\n\u201cHe was a hero, not a traitor. How can he have been a K.G.B. agent? It makes no sense,\u201d she said.\nReleasing the names of people who faced terrible choices \u201cin a different time and a different place,\u201d she added, \u201chas just created more confusion,\u201d not cathartic clarity. It is not clear, she added, what the purported agents did for the K.G.B., and \u201cnobody today really knows what they would have done themselves in such a situation.\u201d\nAs odd as some of the names that appear are those that do not, like Janis Rokpelnis, a well-known Latvian poet who confessed publicly in 2017 to having worked for the K.G.B.\nWhen the spy agency left Latvia, in August 1991, it inexplicably left piles of documents and a partly destroyed Delta electronic database at its sprawling headquarters, known as the Corner House, in central Riga.\nTwo separate indexes of what the K.G.B. classified as agents \u2014 one arranged alphabetically, the other by department \u2014 were found in two sealed sacks and two briefcases. These were moved in November 1991 to a secure room in the Latvian Parliament and transferred in 1993 for safekeeping and study to a newly established Center for the Documentation of the Consequences of Totalitarianism.\nImage\n\u201cFor 12 years, I worked for them with great enthusiasm,\u201d Yuris Taskovs said of his time as an informant for the K.G.B. in Latvia before the collapse of the Soviet Union.\nCredit\nAkos Stiller for The New York Times\nLatvia kept the files locked, restricting access to a few scholars sworn to secrecy and officers of the security services, which used the files for security checks on officials and politicians.\nIndulis Zalite, the former longtime director of the documentation center and now a consultant there, is one of just a few people who has long known the names \u201cin the bags.\u201d He said he doubted the files were left as an ingenious act of sabotage by the departing Soviets.\n\u201cEverything was in chaos in 1991,\u201d he said. \u201cThey could not organize a deep plot. They were too disorganized.\u201d\nAll the same, he cautioned that the documents released so far present \u201conly part of a very big puzzle,\u201d as they give names but no details of what the purported informants did for their handlers. This, he added, reflects a \u201cfake reality\u201d as seen through the eyes of K.G.B. officers who liked to boast of their success penetrating all walks of life.\nImage\nPrison cells in the Corner House, the K.G.B.\u2019s headquarters in Riga.

He confessed to his priest and wife about his informant work.\nImage\nAn office, left, and marked bullet holes in the execution room at the Corner House.\nCredit\nAkos Stiller for The New York Times\nSpeaking in an interview last week at his house in Kukas, a small village in eastern Latvia, he recounted how he had been bullied as a child at school and seen his father humiliated by Soviet police officers. By offering to work for the K.G.B., he said, \u201cI had this secret power and protection.\u201d\nMr. Taskovs said he had now found security in his Christian faith, so can face up to his past collaboration with a system he described as \u201centirely wrong.\u201d But he said it \u201cis absolutely stupid to throw all these names out on the street\u201d by releasing the K.G.B. files because most people \u201cdon\u2019t like to talk about betrayal. They try to escape.\u201d\nMost of what he told his case officer in the nearby town of Jekabpils, he said, \u201cwas just rubbish\u201d and hurt nobody, aside from his neighbor, jailed for a year for viewing pornography.\nHe said the K.G.B. already knew most of what he had put in his hundreds of written reports, which included details of a semi-clandestine environmental group that helped spearhead Latvia\u2019s pro-independence movement in the 1980s. Good with his hands, he offered to make identity cards for the group\u2019s 3,000 members \u2014 and then gave copies of each card to the K.G.B.\nImage\nLidija Lasmane, 93, is a veteran of Latvia\u2019s Soviet-era dissident movement.

She cheered the release of the K.G.B. files, something she has been demanding for decades.\nCredit\nAkos Stiller for The New York Times\n\u201cI told them absolutely everything. Names, places, everything,\u201d he said.\nMost of those \u201cin the bags,\u201d however, are like Ojars Rubenis, the former host of a popular Soviet-era television show, \u201cLabvakar.\u201d Long admired for helping promote Latvian independence, he has now been identified as a Soviet-era agent, along with his two co-hosts of the show.\n\u201cI am not guilty,\u201d Mr. Rubenis snapped when reached by telephone. Noting that relatives had been sent to Siberia by the Soviet authorities, he asked, \u201cWhy would I work for the K.G.B.?\u201d He declined to comment further.\nWhen the files were posted online last month, Vita Zelce, a historian at the University of Latvia, spent all night checking whether anyone she knew had been listed as an informant.\n\u201cI was so nervous and so angry,\u201d she said, recalling how she had found the name of an old primary schoolteacher, whom she had always considered a \u201cnormal, friendly man,\u201d and a distant relative with mental problems.\nImage\nThe release of the K.G.B. files has raised a question for Latvia. Is it slowly coming to terms with the fact that its people were, in some cases, eager collaborators? Or has it fallen prey to a devious plot by the K.G.B. to sow disarray?\nCredit\nAkos Stiller for The New York Times\n\u201cIf these people were really agents, the K.G.B. was a joke,\u201d Ms. Zelce said. \u201cWhat are these files? A real historical record or a strange Soviet disinformation operation? We just don\u2019t know.\u201d\nDeciding who really did what, however, depends on access to documents stored in Moscow, which has a full archive of the Latvian K.G.B.\u2019s reports and lists of informants.\n\u201cUnfortunately,\u201d said Mr. Zalite of the documentation center, \u201cthere is no way to get at that for the moment.\u201d\nLidija Lasmane, a 93-year-old veteran of Latvia\u2019s Soviet-era dissident movement, cheered the release of the files, something she has been demanding for decades. But with many of her own generation now dead, she says it has come much too late either to serve historical truth or settle what she described as a fundamental moral question: \u201cHow does a perfectly normal person become a beast ready to betray their friends, their family and their country?\u201d\nShe said it was true, as many of those so far exposed as K.G.B. collaborators have argued, that the Soviet system put them under terrible pressure, threatening careers and relatives with ruin if they did not cooperate.\n\u201cBut every individual has a choice in the end,\u201d added Ms. Lasmane, who repeatedly chose to defy the Soviet authorities and, as a result, was sent three times to Soviet prison camps, including one in Vorkuta, a particularly forbidding outpost of the Gulag archipelago.\nRaised in a deeply religious Baptist family, she said her faith meant that any collaboration with the K.G.B. had never been an option.\n\u201cI knew from childhood that there is God and also the Devil. For me, there was never a real choice about what to do,\u201d she said.", "html": "<html>\n <body>\n  <div class=\"css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn\">\n   <div class=\"css-4w7y5l\">\n    <p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">\n     <html>\n      <body>\n       <p>\n        KUKAS,\n        <span class=\"pos-link\">\n         Latvia\n        </span>\n        \u2014 Back in Soviet times, Yuris Taskovs snitched to the K.G.B. about a neighbor watching German pornography and betrayed hundreds of anti-Kremlin activists.

A warming climate lets Germans grow grape varieties that once wouldn\u2019t ripen, while their traditional grapes are producing stronger or sweeter results.\nCredit\nGordon Welters for The New York Times\nIn a northern European country where getting even a white grape variety to ripen during a normal growing season was a challenge as recently as three decades ago, the shifting weather now allows for a greater variety of grapes in more places.\n\u201cWe simply don\u2019t have the problem of getting grapes to ripen anymore,\u201d said Mr. W\u00fcrtz.\nLong known for their Riesling and Gew\u00fcrztraminer, German vintners are now able to make premium red wine from grapes that once they couldn\u2019t even grow.\nBesides the traditional Sp\u00e4tburgunder, the light German pinot noir, vintners are now planting cabernet sauvignon and syrah, grapes that were all but unknown in Germany last century.\n100 MILES\nSYLT\nPOLAND\nNETHERLANDS\nBerlin\nGERMANY\nBELGIUM\nCZECH\nREPUBLIC\nNierstein\nWiltingen\nFRANCE\nAUSTRIA\nBy The New York Times\nAt St. Antony in Nierstein, a quaint town a little more than 90 miles east of Wiltingen and close to the Rhine, Mr. W\u00fcrtz is able to make red wine that fetches up to $50 a bottle. Although red wine has been grown in this part of Germany for centuries, it is only recently that it has become good enough to fetch premium prices.\nA 2016 bottle of Sp\u00e4tburgunder from another vintner in the area, Keller, fetched nearly $800 at auction recently, making it the most expensive modern German red wine.\nThe shifting climate may create not just new wines, but new wine regions. A study of average summer temperatures done by the Potsdam Institute of Climate Impact Research predicts that by 2040, most of Germany will be suitable for wine growing. Thirty years ago, only certain parts of the country\u2019s south had the right conditions.\nAlready, vineyards are popping up around Berlin. Since 2010, wine has been harvested on a 10-hectare site on the island of Sylt, just miles from Germany\u2019s northern border with Denmark.\nProducing slightly more than a quarter-billion gallons a year, Germany is one of the smallest of Europe\u2019s major wine-producing countries, making about a fifth as much as Italy, the largest (Spain and France are a close second and third).\nThose figures are likely to change more slowly than the climate does: The expansion of commercial vineyards is tightly regulated by European Union and national laws, and is tied to the current scale of production. So while shifting weather may favor the growth of the German wine sector, laws will keep it much smaller than the European behemoths.\n\u201cWhen it comes to wine, you really have a case where the change might be positive,\u201d said Manfred Stock, a scientist at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research.\nImage\nVineyards in Herxheim, a village on the German Wine Route.\nCredit\nLena Mucha for The New York Times\n\u201cThe northern border has moved,\u201d he said, noting that vintners started to notice a shift in climate as early as the 1980s.\nBut vintners in Germany also see downsides to climate change. Mr. Niewodniczanski says the warmer weather has also made it increasingly difficult to produce the most classic of German wines \u2014 the dry, light, fresh Riesling.\n\u201cWe ignored it at first because it was so good for the quality of the wine,\u201d said Prof. Monika Christmann, the head of Geisenheim University, one of three German universities specializing in wine, about the negative effects. \u201cBut now it\u2019s becoming a touch too much.\u201d\nGrapes ripen so well on traditional fields that the resulting wine is either too sweet or too alcoholic, since the level of alcohol is determined by the sugar levels in the grapes. Harvesting the grapes before they are fully ripened does not solve the problem, says Mr. Niewodniczanski, because it affects the flavor.\nMr. Niewodniczanski has invested millions into recultivating the Geisberg, steep land (on a slope 55 to 65 degrees) in a narrow valley that is less warm while receiving the same amount of light. It was abandoned in the 1960s as not favorable enough for commercial wine production \u2014 now Mr. Niewodniczanski hopes the 12 acres will yield some of his important grapes.\n\u201cThe Geisberg is an example of the importance of climate change,\u201d he said.\nAnd while the new summers tend to be hotter and more favorable to grapes, they are also more chaotic, meaning vintners have to deal with freak weather effects.\n\u201cThere is no bad wine any more \u2014 the only variability is the amount we harvest,\u201d said Mr. W\u00fcrtz, who predicts that his vineyard, St. Antony\u2019s, will produce three to four times the amount of wine it produced last year, when his region suffered late frost and an August hailstorm.\nIn total, Germany is predicted to have a harvest increase of 33 percent in 2018, according to European Union figures.\nAs for the 2018 vintage, Mr. W\u00fcrtz knows there will be a lot of it and that the grapes that produce it will be sweet, but he refuses to say it will actually be the best wine he has ever produced until it has aged.\n\u201cIt\u2019s always a surprise with wine \u2014 we won\u2019t know if the year is really good for years.\u201d", "html": "<html>\n <body>\n  <div class=\"css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn\">\n   <div class=\"css-4w7y5l\">\n    <p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">\n     <html>\n      <body>\n       <p>\n        WILTINGEN,\n        <span class=\"pos-link\">\n         Germany\n        </span>\n        \u2014 In the bright, cavernous basement of the new Van Volxem vinery building, Christoph Dirksen, one of the Mosel region\u2019s most important wine tasters, was making his rounds sampling from giant stainless-steel tanks.\n       </p>\n      </body>\n     </html>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">\n     It\u2019s early to make a final judgment on the wines of 2018, even for Mr. Dirksen, a critic for Vinum, an industry publication.

At age 97. On a public road, alone. And, on Thursday afternoon, straight into the path of a minivan hurtling down a motorway with a 9-month-old boy inside.\nThe crash flipped the armor-plated Land Rover driven by Prince Philip. The minivan careened off the road.\nPrince Philip and the child were unhurt, though a minivan passenger broke her wrist and the driver suffered knee cuts. The prince told police officers he had been \u201cdazzled by the sun,\u201d a witness said.\nStill, some Britons were confused over why the prince, the wizened and gaffe-prone Duke of Edinburgh who is the husband of Queen Elizabeth II, was even driving.\n\u201cYou\u2019d have to be a superhero for your mental acuity not to have slowed down,\u201d said Inger Wallis, a Bloomsbury resident out walking her dog on Friday.\nShe shook her head as she repeated his age, while acknowledging her \u201cdeep respect\u201d for the supporting role he has played for so many decades beside Elizabeth. Ms. Wallis\u2019s own father, she said, hung up the keys at 84, scared to drive.\nIf nothing else, Britons could be thankful that, for one day at least, the agony of Britain\u2019s tortured withdrawal from the European Union was not the leading topic of discussion.\nThe crash, involving a famously headstrong and famously old royal, did provoke a lively discussion about whether Britain should stop older people from driving. The country will have a million drivers older than 85 by 2025, doubled from a few years ago. And those drivers are more vulnerable to crash injuries because of their frailty.\nThat Prince Philip was unaccompanied in the Land Rover by his round-the-clock bodyguards or royal chauffeurs also drew attention to an inconvenient fact, for those who have ever tried to pry the keys from older relatives.\nImage\nThe Obamas and Queen Elizabeth II arriving at the Sovereign\u2019s Entrance in the Quadrangle of Windsor Castle driven by Prince Philip, in 2016.\nCredit\nPool photo by Geoff Pugh\nDriving is a lifeline for some older people, especially in Britain, where smaller towns and rural areas have scant public transit. And older drivers are, by many measures, safer drivers, with people older than 70 half as likely as drivers 25 and younger to kill a pedestrian, the Older Drivers Task Force in Britain said in 2016.\n[When is it time to stop driving? For families everywhere, an all-too-familiar question.]\nIf the government is to take anyone\u2019s keys, experts said, it should target young men.\nArthur Currie, 70, a resident at the Royal Hospital Chelsea for veterans of the British Army, said his relatives sit more stiffly in the passenger seat when he gets behind the wheel. \u201cOr they will say to me, \u2018You see that car coming, Daddy?\u2019\u201d he said. But when they broach the topic of him giving up his keys altogether, Mr. Currie makes his view clear.\n\u201cMy first reaction is looking at them and giving them what they call a laser stare,\u201d he said. \u201cBeing an ex-regimental sergeant major, I have perfected the laser stare.\u201d\nMr. Currie said his only thought, upon hearing about the crash, was concern for Prince Philip and the others involved. As an honorary colonel of the Queen\u2019s Royal Irish Hussars, where Mr. Currie was once a sergeant major, the prince made annual visits to the troops.\n\u201cIf he felt he was able enough to drive, who am I or who\u2019s anybody else to say he shouldn\u2019t be driving?\u201d Mr. Currie said.\nNot all Britons were so deferential.\nJohn Clegg, manning the register at the London Review Bookshop, wondered why the prince could not simply get his driving fix on the private roads of his vast royal estates.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the point in going around in a Land Rover unless you\u2019re going to go off road?\u201d he asked. (Not the most pressing question, perhaps, regarding the solo driving by a 97-year-old royal.)\nMr. Clegg said his grandmother finally persuaded his grandfather to stop driving after too many instances of having to shake him awake.\n\u201cHe never went off the road, but she could see when it could happen,\u201d Mr. Clegg said.\nThe prince is regarded a bit warily by the British public. He is known to be hardheaded and occasionally gruff, and to make racist and sexist comments, including ones about Chinese with \u201cslitty\u201d eyes and women who cannot cook.\nIngrid Seward, a royals expert whose latest book is \u201cMy Husband and I: The Inside Story of 70 Years of the Royal Marriage,\u201d suspected the prince would stubbornly resist the queen\u2019s admonitions about his driving, but would see the logic and could be persuaded to give it up.\nImage\nQueen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip last year. The Duke of Edinburgh is widely known as stubborn, occasionally gruff and gaffe prone.\nCredit\nAlastair Grant/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images\n\u201cIt is the lobotomy of his last vestige of independence,\u201d Ms. Seward said.\nLike many others, Ms. Seward has her own experience trying, with some difficulty, to persuade a parent to relinquish the keys. At 86, her mother took a driving test in an attempt to defy Ms. Seward and prove she could still drive. She failed.\nMs. Seward said Prince Philip may have been alone in the Land Rover because he was only driving from one side of his Sandringham Estate to another. A few years ago, the Obamas got into the car with Prince Philip on the same estate, and looked somewhat less than at ease.\nPrince Philip was known to prize fast sports cars, and the British news media quickly dug up examples of his reckless driving, including one accident in 1996 in which he rear-ended a car at a pedestrian crossing, leaving the driver in a neck brace. As far back as the 1950s, a British tabloid questioned whether he should be trusted to drive the queen around.\nOn Thursday afternoon, he was pulling off a private road and either onto or across a public motorway known for accidents, with its 60 mile-per-hour speed limit and scary bends. Local lawmakers, who coincidentally met on Friday to discuss the road\u2019s safety, lowered the speed to 50 m.p.h.\nAs the British tabloids chronicled in graphic cartoon mock-ups of the crash site, the prince\u2019s car turned over, he was rescued through the sunroof, and had to submit to a breathalyzer test.\nHugh Bladon, 77, a spokesman for the Alliance of British Drivers and a proud older driver, said another alliance member familiar with the road had told him he could understand how the sun may have blinded the prince.\n\u201cObviously, everyone\u2019s going to jump on the age bandwagon,\u201d he said. \u201cBut age actually is nothing to do with skill.\u201d\nBritish law requires drivers at age 70 to start self-reporting medical issues related to their fitness for the road every three years. The Older Drivers Task Force recommended the government raise the age to 75, but also start requiring an eyesight test, a more accurate barometer of any problems.\nBritain instituted driving tests only in 1935, but it is unclear if Prince Philip, who joined the Royal Navy at 18, took one. The royal palace, though, confirmed on Friday that he had a license. The queen, on the other hand, as the person in whose name British licenses are issued, is the only Briton who can drive without one.\nBritish lawyers said there was a chance Prince Philip could be charged with driving without due care and attention, though he could also possibly avoid charges by voluntarily surrendering his license.\nThere were hints on Friday, though, that the prince would not give up quite so easily. A replacement Land Rover was seen by British photographers being driven onto the grounds of his estate, under the watchful eye of the police.", "html": "<html>\n <body>\n  <div class=\"css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn\">\n   <div class=\"css-4w7y5l\">\n    <p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">\n     LONDON \u2014 Prince Philip was at the wheel?\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">\n     To the astonishment and alarm of some Britons, he was.

None of them made it, as men screamed in their faces and hurled coconuts.\nVideo of Ms. Ammini\u2019s journey on Jan. 2 shows two women in long black gowns striding through a gilded archway. They maneuver past mostly placid men. \u201cOur visit has been very smooth,\u201d Ms. Ammini, 40, says to the camera.\nA few hours later, the rest of India woke up. Pandemonium followed.\nProtesters in the state of Kerala, where the shrine is, threw crude bombs at the police. Over 3,000 people were arrested. At least one person was killed. Dozens more were injured.\nImage\nBindu Ammini and Kanakadurga being escorted by the police after an unsuccessful attempt to enter the temple in December.\nCredit\nReuters\nWithin hours of the women\u2019s trip, a priest had shut down the Sabarimala Temple to sprinkle water for a \u201cpurification ritual,\u201d evidence to some that the ban was rooted in a belief that menstruating women were dirty.\nFor days, Ms. Ammini has been on the move: bouncing from one safe house to the next, separated from her husband and daughter and weighing the risks of returning home.\nStill, in an interview near the city of Kochi, she said the trip had been worth it. A lower-caste woman who had grown up in grinding poverty, Ms. Ammini emphasized that her entering the temple should not fall under the category of activism. All she was doing, she said, was exercising a constitutional right to equality.\n\u201cWe were not trying to start trouble,\u201d she said. \u201cOur goal was only to visit the temple. For the next generation of women, this is motivation.\u201d\nEvery year, millions of people wait for hours to climb the 18 gold-plated steps leading to the Sabarimala Temple, one of Hinduism\u2019s holiest shrines. For centuries, however, pilgrims say they have observed a de facto bar against women between the ages of 10 and 50, thinking that to allow menstruating women inside would disturb the temple\u2019s celibate deity, Lord Ayyappa.\nCHINA\nBHUTAN\nPAKISTAN\nNEPAL\nBANGLADESH\nINDIA\nMYANMAR\nKERALA\nKochi\nSRI LANKA\n500 MILES\nBy The New York Times\nThough the historical record suggests that women had sporadically visited the temple for years, Kerala\u2019s High Court made the tradition a law in 1991, which was subsequently overturned by the Supreme Court.\nIn the face of the ensuing protests, Kerala\u2019s governing Communist Party of India offered protection to women who wished to visit the temple. But the police struggled to contain crowds blocking the trail. Rosters of the women who had tried to visit the temple spread on social media. They were marked as \u201cHindu haters,\u201d Maoists, atheists, Muslims and \u201cXtians.\u201d\nMs. Ammini said she was unsurprised; many of the protesters were Hindu nationalists. Fallout from the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling had emboldened far-right groups to promote anti-women \u201cBrahmanical interests,\u201d she said. These were issues she had thought about for most of her life.\nBorn to illiterate parents in Kerala, Ms. Ammini described her childhood as perpetually unstable. Tired of beatings by her husband, Ms. Ammini\u2019s mother fled their small village with her young children, taking menial jobs in hotels and on farms.\nGrowing up, Ms. Ammini was always a bit of a rebel, bending rules that had restricted the lives of so many Indian women. She fell for an upper caste boy. At 17, she joined a feminist group.\nImage\nProtesters scuffling with the police in New Delhi after Ms. Ammini and Ms. Kanakadurga entered the temple.\nCredit\nAdnan Abidi/Reuters\nThe risks of speaking out were underlined during that period. Shortly after a local girl was raped and murdered, Ms. Ammini said she and two other women marched into the office of a senior police official and called for the arrest of the men responsible for the crime.\n\u201cThey were siding with the criminals,\u201d she said.\nInstead, a few days later, the police arrested Ms. Ammini, she said, accusing her of attacking a man and knocking out one of his teeth. After a night locked in the police station, she escaped by jumping from the building\u2019s first floor.\n(Ms. Ammini said she was not convicted in the \u201cfake case.\u201d)\nThe first in her family to attend college, Ms. Ammini gravitated to leftist circles at the University of Calicut and joined the Communist Party of India. She also met her future husband, K.V. Hariharan, a party member, bonding with him over books by Pablo Neruda and humanist writers.\n\u201cEven his love letters were serious,\u201d Ms. Ammini said.\nWith little money, Ms. Ammini wore a $2 sari to her wedding in a building called \u201cFreedom Fighters Hall.\u201d A few years later, she gave birth to a daughter, B.H. Olga, naming her for Olga Ben\u00e1rio Prestes, a German Communist who was killed in a Nazi gas chamber.\nIn her 20s and early 30s, Ms. Ammini earned a law degree and climbed up the ranks of the Communist Party of India, weathering splits and realignments. She was often one of the few women at meetings, an observation that pressed on her. Fed up with the direction of the party, she left politics eight years ago and settled into a position teaching law at Kannur University in Kerala.\nImage\nEvery year, millions of people wait for hours to climb the 18 gold-plated steps leading to the Sabarimala Temple, one of Hinduism\u2019s holiest shrines.\nCredit\nArun Sankar/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images\nThen news of the Supreme Court\u2019s verdict captured her attention.\nIn December, Ms. Ammini joined a Facebook group for women who were interested in visiting the temple. She connected with Kanakadurga, 39, a government employee who came from a Hindu family that had opposed the Supreme Court\u2019s verdict. The women teamed up. Some 4,000 women had registered similar intentions with the police.\nOn Dec. 24, they made a first attempt to reach the temple, but retreated after a mob attacked police officers who were escorting the women. Officials encouraged them to forget it and return home, but Ms. Ammini refused.\n\u201cI decided I would start a hunger strike,\u201d she said. The police backed off.\nOn Jan. 1, inspired by news that several million women had joined hands across Kerala to form a \u201cwomen\u2019s wall\u201d for equality, they decided to try again, recruiting a few police officers to accompany them.\nAt 1:26 a.m. Ms. Ammini and Ms. Kanakadurga, who uses one name, started the climb toward the temple. Near the mouth of the complex, the women beelined for an entrance for V.I.P.s, seeing that the main door was too clogged with people.\nBut inside, nobody confronted the women, Ms. Ammini said. A pilgrim offered her water. They capped off a short visit by praying to the deity. \u201cThe violent mob was out of that place,\u201d she said. \u201cNo devotee raised any voice against our journey to the shrine.\u201d\nImage\nMs. Ammini and Kanakadurga.\nCredit\nSamyukta Lakshmi for The New York Times\nOn the way down, Ms. Ammini said she stopped cooperating with the police, who tried to keep her head covered with a shawl. The women lingered at stalls to buy rice and lemon juice.\n\u201cSome of the media said that the police used us,\u201d she said. \u201cThe fact is that the police were always the ones who were afraid.\u201d\nIn the days after the visit, other women tried unsuccessfully to visit the shrine. This week, two women in men\u2019s clothing were turned back. Another woman angrily claimed that she was prevented from going to the temple even after telling the police that she had no uterus. Ms. Ammini burst out laughing when she heard this.\n\u201cWe definitely have uteruses,\u201d she said.\nNew challenges await the women. The Supreme Court plans to consider review petitions, though lawyers do not expect a reversal of the verdict. This week, after the women left a safe house, Ms. Kanakadurga\u2019s mother-in-law beat her so badly with a piece of wood, she said, that she was hospitalized.\nMs. Ammini said she was realistic about her safety, fretting about a recent ominous \u201csilence\u201d in Kerala. But the way forward \u2014 \u201cto serve the society, work with Dalits, women, for blacks\u201d \u2014 had never been plainer or more urgent, she said.\n\u201cThey may attack me, they may kill me, but I feel no fear,\u201d she said. \u201cI am struggling for existence.\u201d", "html": "<html>\n <body>\n  <div class=\"css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn\">\n   <div class=\"css-4w7y5l\">\n    <p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">\n     <html>\n      <body>\n       <p>\n        KOCHI,\n        <span class=\"pos-link\">\n         India\n        </span>\n        \u2014 One morning this month, Bindu Ammini stood at the base of a steep, forested trail in southern\n        <span class=\"pos-link\">\n         India\n        </span>\n        and looked up: She was a three-mile hike away from making history.\n       </p>\n      </body>\n     </html>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">\n     <html>\n      <body>\n       <p>\n        Two hours later, at 3:45 a.m., Ms. Ammini and a friend became the first women to enter the Sabarimala Temple, a centuries-old Hindu shrine, after\n        <span class=\"pos-link\">\n         India\n        </span>\n        \u2019s Supreme Court\n       </p>\n      </body>\n     </html>\n     <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/sabarimala-temple-women-entry-supreme-court-verdict-1351427-2018-09-28\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"\">\n      struck down a longstanding rule\n     </a>\n     preventing women of menstruating age from visiting.\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">\n     In the wake of that ruling, a dozen women tried in October to climb a slippery path leading to the temple.\n     <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/23/world/asia/india-sabarimala-temple-women.html?rref=collection%2Fbyline%2Fkai-schultz&amp;module=inline\" title=\"\">\n      None of them made it\n     </a>\n     , as men screamed in their faces and hurled coconuts.\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">\n     Video of Ms. Ammini\u2019s journey on Jan. 2 shows two women in long black gowns striding through a gilded archway.

A senior official close to him said Mr. Ghani had dismissed his controversial first vice president, Gen. Abdul Rashid Dostum, from the ticket, with Amrullah Saleh, a former intelligence chief that he recently tapped to lead the country\u2019s police force, replacing him.\nGeneral Dostum is accused of abducting, torturing and sexually assaulting a rival in 2016, the latest in a long history of human rights violations he is alleged to have carried out. The general is likely to support Mr. Ghani behind the scenes while putting forward a confidant, Suraya Dalil, to represent his party in a senior role in the government, the official said.\nThe emergence of powerful candidates reduces the uncertainty over whether the presidential elections, which were delayed after originally having been scheduled for the spring, would happen at all.\nA concerted push by American diplomats to begin negotiations with the Taliban had raised the possibility that the election might be delayed further, or even replaced with an effort to reach a peace settlement that could pave the way for the Taliban\u2019s participation in the government.\nThere was strong pushback against such rumors from the government and Afghanistan\u2019s political parties. And the American-led efforts to persuade the Taliban to sit down with the Afghan government for talks seem to have hit major roadblocks, despite repeated meetings between American diplomats and the insurgents in recent months.\nThe Taliban say they will not meet with Afghan negotiators until they have an agreement with the United States over the future of American troops in the country and the release of insurgent prisoners, among other issues.\nThe July election faces several challenges, chief among them security, with the Taliban threatening large parts of the country. There are also fears that fraud will undermine the voting, as it has so often.\nA parliamentary election in October was tainted by widespread accusations of rigging and mismanagement. Nearly three months later, the results are still not final.\nMohammad Yousef Rashid, who leads the independent Free and Fair Election Forum of Afghanistan, said that the Afghan election commission had struggled to regain the people\u2019s trust after repeated chaotic elections, and that serious reforms were needed before July to avoid a crisis.\n\u201cThese current commissioners are not able to lead the elections and we are aware of their weakness,\u201d Mr. Rashid said. \u201cSecondly, it is about corruption and fraud. Unfortunately, the parliamentary election was full of fraud. If we don\u2019t solve these issues, once again the presidential election will be like a business.\u201d\nThe tickets shaping up for the July race reflect how quickly alliances shift in Afghan politics.\nMr. Atmar got his start as a young intelligence officer in the final days of the Soviet-backed government in the late 1980s, before making his name after the American invasion in 2001 as a respected manager who led several ministries. As his running mates, Mr. Atmar chose two former mujahedeen fighters who joined the guerrilla war against the Soviet-supported government he served, and who also became allies of the Americans after 2001.\nBoth Mr. Atmar and one of his running mates, Mohammed Yonus Qanooni, lost a leg in the last stages of the war against the Soviet Union or soon afterward, when they were on opposing sides.\nMr. Ghani\u2019s ticket also includes former rivals. Until he was appointed as the interior minister last month, Mr. Saleh, now one of Mr. Ghani\u2019s running mates, was a staunch critic of the president.", "html": "<html>\n <body>\n  <div class=\"css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn\">\n   <div class=\"css-4w7y5l\">\n    <p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">\n     <html>\n      <body>\n       <span class=\"pos-link\">\n        Afghanistan\n       </span>\n       \u2019s presidential race is in full swing, with several former officials lining up to challenge President Ashraf Ghani in a vote to be held in July, amid a raging war and fears that yet another fraud-marred election could further destabilize the country.\n      </body>\n     </html>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">\n     On Friday, Mohammad Hanif Atmar, a powerful former national security adviser who parted ways with the government in August, became the most serious challenger to formally join the race so far.

A Norwegian coach gave a Canadian skier a pole so she could compete after her own had broken, enabling Canada to win a silver medal. Norway placed fourth.\nThe showdown continued in last year\u2019s Winter Olympics, when Norway upset Canada in a team curling competition.\n\u201cYou had to bring that up, eh?\u201d Fraser Tolmie, mayor of the Saskatchewan city of Moose Jaw, said in an interview on Saturday.\nThere has been a rivalry, sure, but above all, a friendly one. Now it seems, though, that the line has been crossed.\nMac the Moose, a 32-foot-tall sculpture in Moose Jaw, was the tallest moose sculpture in the world for more than 30 years. Then one was erected in Norway in 2015. At nearly 33 feet, the shiny Norwegian moose sculpture named Storelgen bested Mac for world bragging rights.\n\u201cWe take this personally,\u201d Mr. Tolmie said. \u201cThere are some things that you just don\u2019t do to Canadians: You don\u2019t water down our beer, you don\u2019t tell us we can\u2019t put maple syrup on our pancakes and you don\u2019t mess with Mac the Moose.\u201d\nNorway messed with Mac the Moose.\nStorelgen was designed by Linda Bakke, a Norwegian artist who saw an opportunity to best Canada at something.\n\u201cWhen it was decided to create a sculpture in that dimension, we decided we could just as well step in and make the world\u2019s largest and, in addition, the world\u2019s finest,\u201d Ms. Bakke said. \u201cThat was not so difficult to beat.\u201d\nImage\nThe Norwegian moose sculpture named Storelgen is nearly 33 feet tall, beating one in Canada by about a foot for bragging rights as the world\u2019s tallest.\nCredit\nArco Images GmbH/Alamy\nThe Guardian reported on the outsized moose-measuring contest on Saturday.\nMac the Moose was created in 1984 out of a steel frame, metal mesh to provide the shape, and layers of concrete. It was not only the pride of Moose Jaw but of all of Canada, Mr. Tolmie said.\nNow Moose Jaw has mobilized to make Mac the Moose great again.\nJustin Reves, 32, and Greg Moore, 33, made a video calling on the people of Moose Jaw to action. The duo created a GoFundMe campaign to make Mac the tallest moose sculpture in all the world.\nThe online fund-raiser has raised about $2,000 of its $50,000 goal.

He is set to be inaugurated on Tuesday.\nMartin Fayulu, the runner-up, was contesting the results and demanding a manual recount. The judges of the constitutional court said they had determined that the request for a recount was \u201cabsurd\u201d and that Mr. Fayulu had not provided any proof of fraud.\nMr. Fayulu said early Sunday that the court has \u201cfalsified and countered the truth of the polls to serve an unjust cause and perpetuate a regime that our people hate.\u201d\nImage\nMartin Fayulu, the opposition leader and runner-up in the election, had demanded a manual recount of the results.\nCredit\nTony Karumba/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images\n\u201cI now consider myself the only legitimate president,\u201d he added.\nCongo went to the polls in December in what was intended to be the country\u2019s first democratic handover of power in the 59 years since it gained independence from Belgium. For the past 21 years, the country has been led by the Kabila family, first by Laurent-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Kabila and then by his son Joseph Kabila.\nBut challenges were filed to the court, including by Mr. Fayulu, who said the result was announced only after Mr. Tshisekedi and Joseph Kabila, the outgoing president, came to a power-sharing agreement. The two have denied any such deal.\nFears of violent protest and a crackdown by the government have gripped the nation since the election. The government went as far as cutting internet and text messaging services in an attempt to maintain order in the weeks after the polls. Service was restored on Saturday night.\nOn Saturday, hundreds of supporters of Mr. Tshisekedi gathered in the capital, Kinshasa, to protest the challenge to his win. During a Friday news conference, Mr. Fayulu urged calm ahead of the results.\n\u201cI urge you not to give in to provocation, to avoid anything that can divide us or break national cohesion, including tribal or ethnic hatred,\u201d he said, according to Radio Okapi, a local news outlet.\nSome outside observers also considered the real winner to be Mr. Fayulu based on voting data compiled by the Roman Catholic Church, a powerful force in the country that sent tens of thousands of observers to polling stations. The church said the government\u2019s declaration of Mr. Tshisekedi as the winner did not match up with its data.\nImage\nSupporters of Mr. Tshisekedi faced off with riot police on Saturday as they protested outside the constitutional court in the capital, Kinshasa.\nCredit\nHugh Kinsella Cunningham/EPA, via Shutterstock\nThe African Union on Thursday, after a meeting in the capital of Ethiopia, called for a delay in the court\u2019s announcement of the results, saying \u201cthere were serious doubts on the conformity of the provisional results\u201d in Congo.\nHowever, the Congolese government rejected those recommendations and vowed to go ahead with the process, saying the African Union had no say over the ruling of the country\u2019s court.\nThe African Union plans to send a delegation to Congo \u2014 including Paul Kagame, head of the African Union and president of Rwanda \u2014 to find a way out of the post-electoral crisis.\nThe United Nations also urged a peaceful resolution.\n\u201cWe now hope that the electoral process in the Democratic Republic of Congo will be concluded without violence and in full respect of the will of the Congolese people and the legal and constitutional rules of the country,\u201d Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, secretary general of the United Nations, said during a Friday news conference.\nThe entire election process was troubled from the outset. A planned vote was delayed for more than two years, with the election commission most recently blaming violence, technical problems and an Ebola epidemic.\nMr. Kabila\u2019s government finally yielded to pressure from the international community and the Catholic Church to hold the election.

She said that strangers had followed her, had tried to get her to travel with them and that she had received threatening phone calls.\n\u201cI need the French government to protect me, to assist me, to help me, me and my children,\u201d Ms. Meng told Radio France in an off-air interview on Friday.\nBoth Lib\u00e9ration and Radio France reported that Ms. Meng was supposed to go to the French asylum agency headquarters in Paris on Friday to file an official request.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi postponed an official trip to Europe and Afghanistan over security concerns after President Trump grounded her military flight and White House officials leaked a secret plan for her to fly commercially.\nIt was the latest turn in a bitter tit-for-tat between the president and Ms. Pelosi, who asked Mr. Trump on Wednesday to postpone his State of the Union address.\nLate in the day Friday, Mr. Trump tweeted he would be making a \u201cmajor announcement\u201d about the southern border and government shutdown at 3 p.m. on Saturday from the White House.\nSeparately, Democratic lawmakers pledged to investigate a report that President Trump directed his former lawyer Michael Cohen to lie to Congress.\n_____\nImage\nCredit\nDoug Mills/The New York Times\n2. President Trump plans to meet again with North Korea\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un, in February to push the North to begin denuclearization.\nNegotiations over North Korea\u2019s nuclear arsenal have made little progress since the two leaders\u2019 first meeting in Singapore last June, above, and the new meeting is a sign of how quickly the president has backed away from his initial insistence on fast action by Pyongyang.\nThe announcement came after Mr. Trump met for 90 minutes in the Oval Office with Mr. Kim\u2019s chief nuclear negotiator.\nThe date and location of the meeting will be announced later, the White House said. Vietnam, Thailand and Hawaii have all been mentioned as potential sites.\n_____\nImage\nCredit\nThe International News Service\n3. Winter is here.\nA major storm has swept across the Rockies and should reach the Midwest and Northeast over the three-day holiday weekend, bringing heavy snow, strong winds and frigid temperatures.\nThe system is expected to snarl travel, with winter weather advisories stretching from the Dakotas to Maine. Extreme cold will follow for tens of millions of people.\nBundle up, and visit nytimes.com for updates.

A white Chicago police officer was sentenced to nearly 7 years in prison for murdering Laquan McDonald, a black teenager who became a national symbol of police brutality.\nJason Van Dyke, above, is the city\u2019s first patrolman in almost 50 years to be convicted of murder. He was also sentenced for 16 counts of aggravated battery with a firearm, one for every bullet he fired on that October night in 2014.\nThe killing was captured in a dashcam video seen by millions of horrified viewers. Though an appeal is likely, the sentence provided a measure of finality in a case that exposed the city\u2019s racial divisions and upended its government.\n_____\nImage\nCredit\nFrank Franklin II/Associated Press\n5. RCA Records has dropped R. Kelly, the R&B star accused of decades of misconduct, after weeks of protests and a documentary series that drew national attention.\nMr. Kelly, once one of the biggest and most influential stars in pop music, has been dogged by accusations of sexual misconduct since the mid-1990s, when he was sued by women who said he had engaged in sexual activity with them when they were as young as 15.\nA campaign on social media, #MuteRKelly, asked entertainment companies to stop doing business with Mr. Kelly. The pressure intensified this month after Lifetime broadcast a six-part documentary series, \u201cSurviving R. Kelly,\u201d which included on-camera testimonials by numerous women who said Mr. Kelly had abused them while they were underage.\n_____\nImage\nCredit\nChona Kasinger for The New York Times\n6. Microsoft made a $500 million pledge this week to help address the affordable housing crisis in the Seattle area.\nAnd the company isn\u2019t simply writing checks or building new units \u2014 it\u2019s trying to help fix a market failure, a job government typically does.\nThe announcement is welcome news in the region, where housing costs have risen faster lately than in any other part of the country, like the Ballard neighborhood, above. But the fact that a tech company has to step in points to a long-building reality nationwide: The federal government has largely retreated from this role.\nAs Microsoft unveiled its plans, the Department of Housing and Urban Development remained largely shuttered in Washington during the government shutdown.\n_____\nImage\nCredit\nDanny Moloshok/Reuters\n7. Divorce is always complicated \u2014 even more so when a company\u2019s future is on the line.\nThe announcement that Jeff Bezos and his wife, Mackenzie, are splitting up instantly raised questions about the couple\u2019s $140 billion stake in Amazon.\nAmazon\u2019s investors should be paying attention, our business columnist writes. So should investors in other companies with billionaire founders: Google, Facebook and Snap to name a few. These entrepreneurs often hold special classes of stock that give them extra power.\nMore such breakups are inevitable \u2014 after all, many tech founders are only now reaching the age for the proverbial midlife crisis.\n_____\nImage\nCredit\nIsabella de Maddalena for The New York Times\n8. The streets are closed in Cremona, Italy, and the mayor has asked citizens for silence. Even a broken glass may trigger a police visit.\nCremona was once home to Antonio Stradivari, who in the 17th and 18th centuries produced some of the finest violins and cellos ever made. And an ambitious project to digitally record the sounds of his instruments requires absolute quiet.\nSound engineers using 32 ultrasensitive microphones are producing a database to store all the possible tones that four instruments selected from the Museo del Violino\u2019s collection can produce. The quiet, and the recording, lasts through January.\n_____\nImage\nCredit\nTamara Merino for The New York Times\n9. \u201cWhen it\u2019s blue sky and you\u2019re on the polar plateau, you can feel so small.\u201d\nColin O\u2019Brady, 33, right, and Louis Rudd, 49, spent almost two months racing solo across Antarctica, a journey that killed an explorer who attempted it in 2016. They faced wind chills around minus 70 degrees Fahrenheit, whiteout days with little visibility and isolation, for starters.\nBack in warmer climates, they spoke about the race of a lifetime.\n\u201cIt\u2019s just endless, and you\u2019re like this tiny little speck,\u201d Mr. Brady said. \u201cYou are the only tiny little thing out there in this endless sea of light.\u201d\n_____\nImage\n10. Finally, it\u2019s not just humans looking for love online.\nRomeo was a lonely male Bolivian Sehuencas water frog, thought to be the last of his kind. So conservationists made a dating profile for him \u2014 as a fund-raiser \u2014 and raised enough to send a team into the cloud forest to find his Juliet.\nAnd find her they did. Researchers have high hopes that the species will be saved, as soon as Juliet is out of quarantine for disease testing.\nAfter all, one scientist said, \u201cWe don\u2019t want Romeo to get sick on the first date.\u201d\nHave a fulfilling weekend.\nWe\u2019re off for the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday on Monday and will be back Tuesday.\n_____\nYour Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p.m. Eastern.\nAnd don\u2019t miss Your Morning Briefing.

This is Catherine Porter, filling in for Ian Austen. Like many Canadians, I have China on my mind this week.\nImage\nChinese President Xi Jinping (right) with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. A diplomatic rift between China and Canada has continued to deepen after Robert Schellenberg, a Canadian citizen, was sentenced to death this week for drug trafficking.\nCredit\nLintao Zhang/Getty Images\nA little more than a year ago, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was traveling to Beijing, hoping for a free trade deal. How things have changed. Since Canada carried out an American warrant and arrested Huawei's chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, in the Vancouver airport last month, Canada seems to have become enemy No. 1 of the Chinese government. The price has been steep for three Canadians in particular: Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, both detained in China and accused of threatening national security, as well as Robert Schellenberg, who was hastily retried this week for drug smuggling. His original sentence of 15 years in prison was replaced with the death penalty.\n[Want the Canada Letter in your inbox every week? Sign up here.]\nIn Canada, the sentence has been viewed as a kind of international ransom. But I wondered how the d\u00e9tente has been perceived in China. I reached out to my colleague Chris Buckley. An Australian by birth, Chris has lived in China for more than two decades and studied Chinese Communist Party history at Renmin University in Beijing. He joined The Times in 2012.\nWhat is public opinion of Canada like in China now?\nIt\u2019s not simple. When I walk home from work at night, I pass close by the newly opened Canada Goose store in Beijing, and there have been long lines of people waiting to go in. On the other hand, I think that most Chinese people accept their government\u2019s view that Huawei is being victimized in the West and that Meng Wanzhou was unfairly arrested in Canada.\nHow has the Schellenberg case been reported in Chinese media?\nIt\u2019s been getting attention here in China, too, though not on the same level as it has received in Canada. The cases of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor were reported in the Chinese media, mostly accounts of their arrests and the Chinese foreign ministry\u2019s pushback against criticism. Robert Schellenberg\u2019s appeal hearing and detention attracted more media attention, using the court\u2019s account of the trial. Throughout all this, the Global Times, which is a brashly nationalist newspaper and website, has led the way in criticizing the Canadian government.\nImage\nRobert Lloyd Schellenberg was retried on drug trafficking charges in China this week and was sentenced to death.\nCredit\nIntermediate Peoples\u2019 Court of Dalian\nReporters were invited to observe the trial. Why would China do that?\nIt\u2019s very unusual for foreign reporters to be allowed in to watch criminal trials. I\u2019ve never been inside a Chinese criminal trial. The court hasn\u2019t said exactly why it made an exception in Mr. Schellenberg\u2019s case. But I suspect two reasons. First, the court and government wanted to show that he received what counts for a proper hearing in China. Second, if Mr. Schellenberg is being used as a bargaining chip, it makes sense for the Chinese government to publicize the trial.\nHow unusual is it in China for a pending execution to be publicized?\nIn heinous murders and crimes like that, the government often publicizes executions. In a case like this \u2014 a drug smuggling case involving a foreigner \u2014 it is much less common. This might be the Chinese government sending a warning to potential drug traffickers, or maybe a way of putting pressure on Canada.\nWhat is the feeling among foreigners inside China now?\nForeigners from Western countries, especially Canada, have been a bit spooked by the arrests. There is certainly not a mass exit of Westerners from China. But I think there is a subsection of people who, like Michael Kovrig \u2014 a former diplomat who worked for a policy NGO \u2014 have a government job background and talk to Chinese academics and officials for their work. For them, especially, his arrest seems to have been unnerving.\nImage\nMeng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of Huawei, leaving her home in Vancouver last month with a security guard.\nCredit\nJonathan Hayward/The Canadian Press, via Associated Press\nWhere do you see this going?\nMs. Meng\u2019s fight against possible extradition to the United States could take many months, even longer. How long it takes for Mr. Schellenberg to work through his appeal and other means for seeking clemency depends very much on how slow or fast the Chinese government wants to go. So for Mr. Schellenberg this could be a long, agonizing wait. Meanwhile, Mr. Kovrig and Mr. Spavor remain in detention and haven\u2019t even been formally charged with specific crimes.

The cases of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor were reported in the Chinese media, mostly accounts of their arrests and the Chinese foreign ministry\u2019s pushback against criticism. Robert Schellenberg\u2019s appeal hearing and detention attracted more media attention, using the court\u2019s account of the trial. Throughout all this, the Global Times, which is a brashly nationalist newspaper and website, has led the way in criticizing the Canadian government.\n       </p>\n      </body>\n     </html>\n    </p>\n   </div>\n   <aside class=\"css-1m2ozyi\">\n    <span>\n    </span>\n   </aside>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"css-79elbk ehw59r11\" data-testid=\"photoviewer-wrapper\">\n   <div class=\"css-z3e15g\" data-testid=\"photoviewer-wrapper-hidden\">\n   </div>\n   <div class=\"css-1a48zt4 ehw59r111\" data-testid=\"photoviewer-children\">\n    <figure aria-label=\"media\" class=\"css-1lghxe1 e1g7ppur0\" itemid=\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/19/world/19canadaletter-2/merlin_149164569_c2dd26a6-7814-4afe-9547-c35e318ac5dc-articleLarge.jpg?quality=90&amp;auto=webp\" itemprop=\"associatedMedia\" itemscope=\"\" itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageObject\" role=\"group\">\n     <div class=\"css-1xdhyk6 erfvjey0\">\n      <span class=\"css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0\">\n       Image\n      </span>\n      <div class=\"css-zjzyr8\">\n       <div data-testid=\"lazyimage-container\" style=\"height:257.77777777777777px\">\n       </div>\n      </div>\n     </div>\n     <figcaption class=\"css-1l44abu e1xdpqjp0\" itemprop=\"caption description\">\n      <span class=\"css-8i9d0s e13ogyst0\">\n       <html>\n        <body>\n         <p>\n          Robert Lloyd Schellenberg was retried on drug trafficking charges in\n          <span class=\"pos-link\">\n           China\n          </span>\n          this week and was sentenced to death.\n         </p>\n        </body>\n       </html>\n      </span>\n      <span class=\"css-vuqh7u e1z0qqy90\" itemprop=\"copyrightHolder\">\n       <span class=\"css-1ly73wi e1tej78p0\">\n        Credit\n       </span>\n       <span>\n        Intermediate Peoples\u2019 Court of Dalian\n       </span>\n      </span>\n     </figcaption>\n    </figure>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn\">\n   <div class=\"css-4w7y5l\">\n    <p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">\n     <strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\">\n      <html>\n       <body>\n        <p>\n         Reporters were invited to observe the trial.

I\u2019ve never been inside a Chinese criminal trial. The court hasn\u2019t said exactly why it made an exception in Mr. Schellenberg\u2019s case. But I suspect two reasons. First, the court and government wanted to show that he received what counts for a proper hearing in\n        <span class=\"pos-link\">\n         China\n        </span>\n        . Second, if Mr. Schellenberg is being used as a bargaining chip, it makes sense for the Chinese government to publicize the trial.\n       </p>\n      </body>\n     </html>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">\n     <strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\">\n      <html>\n       <body>\n        <p>\n         How unusual is it in\n         <span class=\"pos-link\">\n          China\n         </span>\n         for a pending execution to be publicized?\n        </p>\n       </body>\n      </html>\n     </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">\n     <html>\n      <body>\n       <p>\n        In heinous murders and crimes like that, the government often publicizes executions. In a case like this \u2014 a drug smuggling case involving a foreigner \u2014 it is much less common. This might be the Chinese government sending a warning to potential drug traffickers, or maybe a way of putting pressure on\n        <span class=\"pos-link\">\n         Canada\n        </span>\n        .\n       </p>\n      </body>\n     </html>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">\n     <strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\">\n      <html>\n       <body>\n        <p>\n         What is the feeling among foreigners inside\n         <span class=\"pos-link\">\n          China\n         </span>\n         now?\n        </p>\n       </body>\n      </html>\n     </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">\n     <html>\n      <body>\n       <p>\n        Foreigners from Western countries, especially\n        <span class=\"pos-link\">\n         Canada\n        </span>\n        , have been a bit spooked by the arrests.

So I think this story will be in the news for many months to come, and maybe longer.\n       </p>\n      </body>\n     </html>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">\n     <em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">\n      ___\n     </em>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">\n     <em class=\"css-2fg4z9 e1gzwzxm0\">\n      <html>\n       <body>\n        <p>\n         This week\u2019s Trans\n         <span class=\"pos-link\">\n          Canada\n         </span>\n         and Around The Times highlights were compiled by Lindsey Wiebe, the\n         <span class=\"pos-link\">\n          Canada\n         </span>\n         audience growth editor.\n        </p>\n       </body>\n      </html>\n     </em>\n    </p>\n   </div>\n   <aside class=\"css-1m2ozyi\">\n    <span>\n    </span>\n   </aside>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn\">\n   <div class=\"css-4w7y5l\">\n    <h2 class=\"css-1505tg eoo0vm40\" id=\"link-b4a7c02\">\n     <html>\n      <body>\n       <p>\n        Trans\n        <span class=\"pos-link\">\n         Canada\n        </span>\n       </p>\n      </body>\n     </html>\n    </h2>\n    <p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">\n     \u2014Robert Lloyd Schellenberg plans to appeal after being\n     <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/14/world/asia/china-canada-schellenberg-retrial.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">\n      sentenced to death for drug smuggling\n     </a>\n     <html>\n      <body>\n       <p>\n        this week in China, amid a deepening diplomatic rift between\n        <span class=\"pos-link\">\n         Canada\n        </span>\n        and China.\n       </p>\n      </body>\n     </html>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">\n     <html>\n      <body>\n       <p>\n        \u2014The 18-year-old who fled\n        <span class=\"pos-link\">\n         Saudi Arabia\n        </span>\n       </p>\n      </body>\n     </html>\n     <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/14/world/canada/rahaf-mohammed-alqunun-interview.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">\n      <html>\n       <body>\n        <p>\n         is ready to experience life as a teenager in\n         <span class=\"pos-link\">\n          Canada\n         </span>\n        </p>\n       </body>\n      </html>\n     </a>\n     .

Rubin, the Times Paris bureau chief who won a Pulitzer Prize for foreign reporting on Afghanistan in 2015; Azmat Khan, an investigative reporter and New York Times Magazine contributor, who uncovered civilian casualties among nearly 150 airstrike sites across northern Iraq; and writer Brian Castner, a veteran of the Iraq war and weapons expert for Amnesty International\u2019s crisis team, who also investigates war crimes and human rights violations.\nGet tickets here.\nThe Latest Stories From At War\nAfghan War Casualty Report: Jan. 11-17\nAt least 62 pro-government forces and three civilians were killed in Afghanistan during the past week.\nJan. 18, 2019\nRead the Afghan War Casualty Report from previous weeks \u00bb\nEditor\u2019s Picks\nThe Hunt for the Nazi Loot Still Sitting on Library Shelves: The art stolen by the Nazis has gotten more attention, but millions of books were also looted from Jews, and others, and have yet to be returned.\n\u2018The Taliban Made Me Fight\u2019: What to Do With Child Recruits After They Serve Time?: Afghan children as young as 8 have been imprisoned after being caught preparing suicide attacks.

It emphasized Germany\u2019s appreciation that it had been welcomed back as a sovereign nation after the conflict and as a European power.\n\u201cThis we, as Germans, have not forgotten and we are grateful,\u201d the letter went on, concluding that \u201cBritons should know: From the bottom of our hearts, we want them to stay.\u201d\nNorbert R\u00f6ttgen, head of the German Parliament\u2019s Committee on Foreign Affairs, who co-wrote the letter, said the signers decided they needed to say something after this week\u2019s defeat of the British prime minister\u2019s Brexit proposal.\n\u201cThe time was ripe to make sure that we raise our voice, and that we try to make it a German voice, to let the Brits know that while we fully respect what they decide, we do consider it a European affair,\u201d Mr. R\u00f6ttgen said. \u201cWe wanted to say what we feel, to express our convictions and our deep emotions.\u201d\n[Read about an unlikely Brexit star, and villain: the speaker of the British House of Commons.]\nThe intervention comes at a critical moment in Britain following the crushing rejection on Tuesday of Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s plan for withdrawal from the European Union, or Brexit. There is growing speculation that the deadlock could lead to a general election or a second referendum that might reverse the whole idea.\nIt is unclear whether a lovebomb from figures as varied as the Airbus chief, Thomas Enders, and the punk rock singer Campino will have much impact.

Germany\u2019s affection for Britain is not always reciprocated, despite widespread respect for the German postwar economic miracle and its modern-day success.\nSporting rivalry is particularly fierce in soccer, where the record has at times been so grim for England that Gary Lineker, the TV host and former England international player, once described it as a game where \u201c22 men chase a ball for 90 minutes and at the end, the Germans always win.\u201d\nWhether the intervention will help or hinder the pro-Europeans in Britain\u2019s Brexit debate is a moot point, as the British are prickly about anything that could be construed as outside interference in political discussions.\nSpeaking to reporters in London, Tony Blair, the former prime minister, welcomed the letter, saying it redressed the impression that Brexit negotiations were frequently confrontational.\n\u201cA clear statement acknowledging what is clearly true \u2014 that it\u2019s better for Europe as well as for Britain that we change Brexit \u2014 is important,\u201d said Mr. Blair, who is arguing for a second Brexit referendum.\nHe added that he believed the initiative had come about because, with Parliament deadlocked, there was an increased possibility of a second referendum. However, he added, \u201cIf we do decide that we want to think again, I think it\u2019s important that Europe indicates that its politics has changed in the last 30 months and that means particularly addressing the question of immigration.\u201d\nThose on the other side of the debate, of course, took the opposite view. One Brexit hard-liner in Parliament, John Redwood, wrote on Twitter that members of the German establishment had shown \u201ctheir scorn for democracy,\u201d were taking the British \u201cfor fools\u201d and wanted to keep Britain in the European Union only because of its annual budget payments.\nMr. R\u00f6ttgen dismissed such criticism as entirely predictable: \u201cThat this letter would be used and abused by those who are so desperate to leave, under any circumstance, that they reject the idea of reconsidering anything, this was quite clear.\u201d\nThough the letter sounded genuine and sincere, some Germans believe Britain has become such an awkward partner in the European Union that it is better outside the bloc.\nWhen Andrea Nahles, one signer of the letter, wrote on Twitter this week of her regret at the implications of the defeat of Mrs. May\u2019s plan, the response was mixed, and much less sentimental than the letter published on Friday.\nA British TV news anchor, Matt Frei, suggested that the authentic view of Brexit in Germany might be a little less diplomatic. On Twitter he described a conversation in Berlin that drew a parallel to Prince Philip\u2019s car accident this week.\n\u201cOverheard in a Berlin bakery,\u201d he wrote, \u201cBrexit is like a 97 year old royal behind the wheel.

Since the signing of the peace accords, the Colombian government has said it turned the page on that violent era.\nVideo\nA car bomb exploded in front of a police academy in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia, killing at least 10 people. Witnesses said the blast was big and broke windows.\nCredit\nCredit\nMauricio Duenas Castaneda/EPA, via Shutterstock\nScenes of the carnage near the academy told a different story. Cellphone videos shared with The New York Times on Friday and filmed by someone who was at the scene showed a burning vehicle with a dismembered torso in blue pants sprawled in front of the flames. The camera also captured images of a human foot and what appeared to be a severed head.\nRescue workers struggled to carry possible survivors out on stretchers.\nThe attack against security forces in Colombia\u2019s center of power was an escalation of hostilities with the ELN, which in the past year has bombed police stations, attacked oil pipelines and kidnapped soldiers, policemen and military contractors.\nIn a speech on Friday night, President Iv\u00e1n Duque of Colombia announced that Colombian authorities had reactivated arrest warrants for members of the ELN leadership and had asked Cuba, where 10 members are based, to extradite them.\n\u201cThe ELN is and has been a criminal machine of kidnappings and attacks,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have had enough of death.\u201d\nEven before the attack, Mr. Duque, whose right-wing Democratic Center party campaigned against the peace deal with the FARC, expressed little enthusiasm for negotiating with the ELN.\nImage\nA vigil outside the police academy. The attack on Thursday was the first car bombing in Bogot\u00e1 in years.\nCredit\nLeonardo Munoz/EPA, via Shutterstock\n\u201cIf the ELN really wants peace,\u201d he said on Friday, \u201cthey need to show the country concrete actions, like the immediate return of all kidnapped people and the end of all criminal actions.\u201d\nMr. Botero, the defense minister, said the attacker, Mr. Rojas, had joined the ELN in the 1990s and worked as an explosives instructor. He lost a hand at one point in an explosion and thereafter was known by the nickname \u201cMocho,\u201d slang in Colombia for someone who is missing a hand or arm.\nIn 2015, as the FARC was nearing its peace deal with the government, Mr. Rojas had tried three times to pass himself off as a member of that group to receive demobilization benefits, but FARC members rejected him repeatedly, said Mr. Botero, the defense minister.\nThe FARC, which has given up arms and formed a political party, worked to distance itself from the attack this week.\n\u201cWe express our solidarity with the victims and their families,\u201d the party wrote in a statement after the attack. \u201cAnd we call on all sectors of the country to keep building a pact that takes violence and weapons out of doing politics.\u201d\nImage\nThe suspect in the car bombing attack, Jos\u00e9 Aldemar Rojas Rodr\u00edguez, was part of a Marxist rebel group known as the ELN.\nCredit\nAttorney General'S Office, via European Pressphoto Agency\nBut the ELN has taken a different stance from their former guerrilla brethren.\nLast January, a faction of the group claimed responsibility for an attack that killed five police officers and wounded 40 others in a Colombian port city. During the summer, they tried to coax the government into negotiations by offering nine hostages for ransom. The kidnappings continued even this month, when the group said it had downed a civilian helicopter and taken three more hostages.\nJeremy McDermott, the co-founder of Insight Crime, a foundation that tracks criminal groups, said the group\u2019s fractured command structure meant that some factions kept fighting the government even while others may express interest in a peace deal.\n\u201cThe ELN isn\u2019t a vertically integrated organization,\u201d he said.\nHis foundation is also tracking another problem for the government: Former rebels of the FARC who have taken up arms once again. Last fall, Insight Crime estimated that as many as 2,800 fighters may have returned to arms \u2014 about 40 percent of the number that fought before the peace deal.\nJairo Libreros, a professor at Externado University in Bogot\u00e1 who also works as a security analyst, said he saw little option for the government other than to continue fighting guerrilla groups like the rogue FARC fighters and ELN.\n\u201cThe ELN is still anchored in ideologies from the last century,\u201d he said, referring to its vows to continue Marxist struggle. \u201cBut this attack closes any window there was for negotiation in the short term.\u201d", "html": "<html>\n <body>\n  <div class=\"css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn\">\n   <div class=\"css-4w7y5l\">\n    <p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">\n     <html>\n      <body>\n       <p>\n        BOGOT\u00c1,\n        <span class=\"pos-link\">\n         Colombia\n        </span>\n        \u2014 The suspect in a car bombing that left 21 people dead on Thursday in the Colombian capital, Bogot\u00e1, was a member of the largest guerrilla group remaining in the country, the Colombian government said Friday.\n       </p>\n      </body>\n     </html>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">\n     Jos\u00e9 Aldemar Rojas Rodr\u00edguez, the suspect who was also killed that day, was part of the National Liberation Army, a Marxist rebel group known as the ELN, said Guillermo Botero, the Colombian defense minister.\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">\n     <html>\n      <body>\n       <p>\n        The ELN did not claim responsibility, but it has increased attacks against the government since its rival guerrilla group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of\n        <span class=\"pos-link\">\n         Colombia\n        </span>\n        , or the FARC, signed a peace deal with the government in 2016.\n       </p>\n      </body>\n     </html>\n    </p>\n   </div>\n   <aside class=\"css-1m2ozyi\">\n    <span>\n    </span>\n   </aside>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn\">\n   <div class=\"css-4w7y5l\">\n    <p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">\n     The attack on Thursday, near a police academy, was the first car bombing in Bogot\u00e1 in years, a gruesome reminder of an era when such attacks were the norm, as drug lords and rebel groups waged aggressive terror campaigns, killing hundreds of civilians and security forces.

Along with other wildlife, they have taken over the island, a former prison colony with a small ghost town and vast green expanses, just off the coast of Tasmania, south of the Australian mainland.\nLooking like big teddy bears, the stocky, furry animals \u2014 each about three feet long and weighing 50 to 70 pounds \u2014 have no fear of people, and amble up to visitors as soon as they get off the ferry.

Wombats are herbivores, but they have powerful jaws and big claws for burrowing, and have been known to bite and scratch people who startle them or approach their young.\nLocal businesses and Tasmania\u2019s Parks and Wildlife service have come up with a pledge, posted at the ferry to the island and online.\nOne part of the pledge reads:\nWombats, when you trundle past me I pledge I will not chase you with my selfie stick, or get too close to your babies. I will not surround you, or try and pick you up. I will make sure I don\u2019t leave rubbish or food from my morning tea. I pledge to let you stay wild.\nMaria Island is just one example of a phenomenon known as overtourism, accelerated by technology. It clogs celebrated towns with pedestrian traffic and prompts questions about whether the love of art has been overtaken by the love of documenting the experience of viewing art.\nHumans seeking the perfect selfie have even been known to imperil their own lives \u2014 a phenomenon named the \u201ckillfie.\u201d\nBut people interfering with animals, failing to understand that wild creatures really are wild, is a growing problem, too.\nSometimes it stems from misplaced compassion, like in the spring of 2016, when visitors at Yellowstone National Park, who thought a baby bison was cold, took the calf into their car and drove it to a ranger station. Later, rejected by its own herd, the calf was euthanized.\nOften, recklessness is to blame. Last year a woman in Transylvania was injured when she tried to take a selfie with a bear.\nThe trend has prompted officials around the world to look for ways to keep wildlife and visitors safe from each other. In the United States, the National Park Service, for example, invites visitors to take the \u201cYellowstone Pledge,\u201d available in 10 languages.\n\u201cPractice safe selfies by never approaching animals to take a picture,\u201d is the top point in the pledge.\nAnd animal protection organizations have called on Instagram to crack down on \u201cbad selfies,\u201d those that involve hugging and holding wildlife. The social network has posted warnings on popular hashtags, like those used by people taking selfies with quokkas, another kind of marsupial, in Australia last year.\nBut as some selfies themselves show, Australia also abounds with opportunities to interact with wombats and others in zoos and parks, where professionals can keep an eye on their welfare.", "html": "<html>\n <body>\n  <div class=\"css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn\">\n   <div class=\"css-4w7y5l\">\n    <p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">\n     LONDON \u2014 Don\u2019t pester the wombats.\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">\n     That is the plea from Australian tourism officials dealing with hordes of visitors to an island and nature preserve who cannot resist the urge to follow the marsupials around, approach them for selfies or even cuddle them.\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">\n     Wombats roam free on Maria Island, where there are no natural predators and no permanent human inhabitants.

Some said a culture of toxic masculinity had led to the violent assault and murder of hundreds of women in Australia in recent years, though usually at the hands of people they knew.\nOn average, according to figures released last year by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, one woman is killed by a partner or ex-partner every week in Australia.

They are from Baqa al-Gharbiyye, a predominantly Arab city in the north of Israel, and identify as Palestinian.\n\u201cFor her to come here and be met by this kind of violence, it\u2019s terrifying,\u201d said Tasnim Sammak, a 27-year-old Ph.D. student at Monash University and a member of Melbourne\u2019s Palestinian community, which has rallied together in support of the family.\nSome sat huddled on the steps around Ms. Maasarwe\u2019s father, Saeed Maasarwe, who had flown to Australia to identify his daughter\u2019s body.\nNothing, said Mr. Maasarwe, could bring his daughter back, but it comforted him to see so many people there. \u201cI don\u2019t hate or have ill feelings, my compass points towards a better future for everyone,\u201d he said.\nDaniel Andrews, the premier of Victoria, was among those who sent condolences to Ms. Maasarwe\u2019s family and friends on social media. \u201cShe should have been safe here,\u201d he said on Twitter. \u201cAnd I am heartbroken she wasn\u2019t.\u201d", "html": "<html>\n <body>\n  <div class=\"css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn\">\n   <div class=\"css-4w7y5l\">\n    <p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">\n     <html>\n      <body>\n       <p>\n        MELBOURNE,\n        <span class=\"pos-link\">\n         Australia\n        </span>\n        \u2014 The authorities in\n        <span class=\"pos-link\">\n         Australia\n        </span>\n        have charged a 20-year-old man with the rape and murder of Aiia Maasarwe, an Israeli exchange student who was attacked on a Melbourne street this week.\n       </p>\n      </body>\n     </html>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">\n     The man, Codey Herrmann, of the Melbourne suburb of Greensborough, was arrested on Friday afternoon and was charged in the Melbourne Magistrates\u2019 Court on Saturday.

But he also made the Satan statue relatively paunchy. He wears a benign smile and is portrayed taking a selfie with a bronze mobile phone.\nLast year, the local council commissioned the statue, inspired by a local legend, to lure tourists to a less-popular part of Segovia\u2019s Old Town, a Unesco heritage site. The city of 52,000 people north of Madrid is known for its 16th-century Gothic cathedral, a Moorish castle called Alc\u00e1zar and a 2,000-year-old Roman aqueduct.\nThe statue was to be placed on a wall above the Old Town, and the presentation appeared to be a marriage of modern culture and an ancient myth.\nBut the dispute is raising new questions about the coexistence of religion and artistic freedom in Spain.\nA group of Catholics in Segovia were outraged by plans for the statue, saying that a friendly Devil amounted to \u201cglorifying evil\u201d and would be deeply offensive to Catholics.\nA petition to get rid of the statue gathered more than 5,000 signatures in three months. The San Miguel and San Frutos Association sought a court injunction to stop the installation.\n\u201cWe found it repulsive, we think it\u2019s obscene, and we don\u2019t think that this statue is suitable to represent the city,\u201d Maria Esther L\u00e1zaro, a founder of the association, said by phone on Friday.\nThe artist, for his part, said that he was surprised and hurt by the controversy.\n\u201cIt was an enormous surprise to see some people, not even many of them, contest the statue,\u201d Mr. Abella said in a phone interview.\n\u201cSegovia is a normal city with normal people,\u201d he added, \u201cand it hurts me to see the image of the place where I have lived for some 30 years damaged by this.\u201d\nTo Mr. Abella, the statue has nothing to do with religion. It refers to a Segovia myth that the Devil, not the Romans, had given the city its famous aqueduct, which towers 90 feet over the Old Town of Segovia.\nAccording to the legend, the Devil offered a deal to a young girl who was tired of dragging water through the city\u2019s steep streets: He would get the water to her home before dawn, in return for her soul. As the Devil labored all night to build the aqueduct, she prayed. A storm came, holding up the Devil\u2019s work, and in the end, he lost his bid by one stone.\nMs. Lazaro said the statue was a departure from the true message of the legend: to \u201ctake care of one\u2019s soul and repent.\u201d\nIn recent years, Spain has seen similar high-profile court cases led by the Spanish Association of Christian Lawyers. The association has mostly used an article in the Spanish criminal code that forbids \u201coffending the feelings of members of a religious confession.\u201d\nIn 2014, the association tried to remove the director of the Reina Sofia art museum in Madrid for displaying artwork that alluded to burning churches. In 2017, it filed a complaint against a drag queen who performed as the Virgin Mary and Jesus on the cross. And the actor and theater producer Willy Toledo was briefly detained by the police last year after he ignored a court summons for publishing insults about God and the Virgin Mary online. He is still awaiting trial.\nOther cases have targeted political art. Last year, a work labeling Catalonia\u2019s separatist leaders as political prisoners was removed from an international art fair.\nSegovia, popular with tourists, had largely avoided such controversy \u2014 until the Devil appeared. Mr. Abella, a retired doctor who works as a novelist and occasional sculptor, had offered his statue to the city free. The idea for it came from a conversation with city officials in which Mr. Abella recalled the smiling Devil he had seen years ago in the German city of L\u00fcbeck.\nOn Thursday, a judge rejected the injunction request against the statue and ordered the Christian association to pay 500 euros, or about $570, in legal fees, according to a court email on Friday.\nEven if there is further opposition, the short, jovial Devil is likely to take up residence in the city next week, Claudia De Santos, who leads the city\u2019s heritage and tourism department, said by phone on Friday.\nMs. de Santos told El Pa\u00eds that the Catholic association had claimed that Segovia would become a focal point for satanic worship.\n\u201cI just can\u2019t believe that this could happen in 21st-century Spain,\u201d she said.", "html": "<html>\n <body>\n  <div class=\"css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn\">\n   <div class=\"css-4w7y5l\">\n    <p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">\n     <html>\n      <body>\n       <p>\n        The Devil was set to come to the notable city of Segovia,\n        <span class=\"pos-link\">\n         Spain\n        </span>\n        , when some Catholic residents objected to those plans and began a legal challenge to run Satan out of town.\n       </p>\n      </body>\n     </html>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">\n     To be sure, officials had invited the Devil, in the form of a five-foot bronze statue created by a local artist, Jos\u00e9 Antonio Abella.\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">\n     Mr. Abella gave his statue the requisite two horns and made him explicitly nude.

Renault, the third automaker in the global car alliance that Mr. Ghosn ran, is also preparing to cut ties with its star executive.\nMr. Ghosn has been detained in Tokyo since Nov. 19 on suspicion of understating his salary for eight years, and of temporarily transferring personal investment losses to Nissan\u2019s books during the 2008 financial crisis. Mr. Ghosn has denied all charges. His lawyers could not immediately be reached for comment.\nMitsubishi\u2019s findings involve a joint venture between Nissan and Mitsubishi established in 2017 in the Netherlands. The company said Mr. Ghosn, who is listed as a director of the joint venture, had drawn up an employment contract that rewarded him \u20ac7.8 million in compensation.\nThe joint venture had been set up to distribute part of the savings generated by Nissan\u2019s 2017 acquisition of Mitsubishi to the departments at the automakers that generated the savings, a kind of incentive scheme to bring the companies closer together.\nThe joint venture\u2019s other directors \u2014 Mr. Masuko and Nissan\u2019s chief executive, Hiroto Saikawa \u2014 were unpaid and kept in the dark about Mr. Ghosn\u2019s compensation, according to Mitsubishi. The company learned about the payment only after Nissan shared the findings of its internal investigation into Mr. Ghosn, it said.\nImage\nOsamu Masuko, Mitsubishi\u2019s chief executive, left, said that the automaker was considering suing Mr. Ghosn, its former chairman.\nCredit\nEugene Hoshiko/Associated Press\n\u201cNobody, including myself, was informed,\u201d Mr. Masuko said.\nIt is unclear whether Mr. Ghosn\u2019s compensation broke any laws. The joint venture was an unincorporated subsidiary of Mitsubishi and Nissan registered in the Netherlands, meaning it is likely to be beyond the purview of Japanese financial regulators.\nMitsubishi\u2019s allegations are the latest twist in a fall from grace for Mr. Ghosn, an industry titan. Nissan and Mitsubishi have already removed Mr. Ghosn from his posts as chairman at the two companies, though he remains on their boards.\nNissan owns a controlling stake in Mitsubishi Motors, while Renault is Nissan\u2019s biggest shareholder.\nRenault had stood by Mr. Ghosn, keeping him as chairman and chief executive even as he sat in a Tokyo jail. But after a Tokyo court rejected his bail request Tuesday, the French government called for new leadership at the automaker. Its board is expected to meet in the coming days to consider cutting ties with him.\nTwo French officials, including the government\u2019s representative on the Renault board, were in Tokyo for meetings this week, though Nissan has declined to comment on any discussions.\nNaming a successor to Mr. Ghosn would not necessarily mean Renault considered him guilty of wrongdoing. It could instead reflect a realistic assessment of the executive\u2019s inability to perform his duties from jail, where he has limited contact with the outside world.\nMitsubishi, meanwhile, will \u201cpush forward with its investigation,\u201d Mr. Masuko said.", "html": "<html>\n <body>\n  <div class=\"css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn\">\n   <div class=\"css-4w7y5l\">\n    <p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">\n     TOKYO \u2014 Mitsubishi Motors has joined Nissan in accusing Carlos Ghosn of financial wrongdoing, saying on Friday that he secretly received compensation of 7.8 million euros, or almost $9 million, from a joint venture of the two automakers.\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">\n     Osamu Masuko, Mitsubishi\u2019s chief executive, told reporters in Tokyo that the automaker was considering suing Mr. Ghosn, the former chairman of both Nissan and Mitsubishi.

Blue for The New York Times\nFamily separations at the border went uncounted\nThe Trump administration most likely separated thousands more migrant children from their parents at the southwestern border than was previously believed, according to a government report released on Thursday.\nThe federal government has reported that nearly 3,000 children were forcibly separated from their parents last year under the \u201czero tolerance\u201d immigration policy. But inspectors from the Department of Health and Human Services found that there was no coordinated tracking system, meaning the total number is \u201cunknown.\u201d\nCatch up: The separations were a crucial part of the administration\u2019s effort to deter migrant families, many fleeing violence and poverty in Central America, from trying to enter the U.S.\nU.S. plans to expand its missile defenses\nPresident Trump on Thursday endorsed an updated effort to detect and intercept missiles bound for the U.S., evoking Ronald Reagan\u2019s 1983 \u201cStar Wars\u201d program.\nDetails released by the Pentagon suggested something more incremental, aimed largely at destroying small numbers of missiles launched by regional powers, rather than overwhelming strikes from Russia or China.\nGo deeper: The U.S. has spent more than $300 billion on antimissile projects over the decades, according to one expert. Our video explains the projects\u2019 unimpressive rate of success.\nAnother angle: In his speech on Thursday, the president did not mention the threat from North Korea, long a focus of missile-defense advocates. A North Korean envoy is in Washington today, as part of an effort to set up a second summit meeting between Mr. Trump and Kim Jong-un, the North\u2019s leader.\nChicago officers are acquitted of a cover-up\nThree police officers were acquitted on Thursday of charges that they had conspired and lied to protect a white officer who fatally shot a black teenager in 2014.\nOfficer Jason Van Dyke, who was convicted in October of the second-degree murder of Laquan McDonald, is to be sentenced today.\nBackground: While in view of a police dashboard camera, Mr. Van Dyke fired 16 shots at Laquan, who was holding a knife. The shooting prompted citywide protests, the firing of Chicago\u2019s police chief and a federal investigation.\nIf you have 18 minutes, this is worth it\nWhat if we misinterpret DNA from ancient bones?\nImage\nCredit\nDavid Maurice Smith for The New York Times\nGeneticists have begun using bones to make sweeping claims about the distant past.

It had been years since such an attack in the city, which was once terrorized by drug traffickers and leftist guerrillas.\nLos Angeles teachers\u2019 strike: The city\u2019s school superintendent and the president of the teachers\u2019 union met face-to-face on Thursday for the first time since the walkout began in the country\u2019s second-largest public school system. But negotiations still appeared to be at an impasse.\nBrexit deadlock is extended: Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain must return to Parliament on Monday with a Plan B for pulling the country from the European Union, after lawmakers soundly rejected her original proposal this week. A vote on the alternative isn\u2019t expected until Jan. 29, two months before the scheduled withdrawal.\nL train shutdown: Two weeks after Gov. Andrew Cuomo offered a last-minute solution to avert a major New York City subway disruption, it\u2019s unclear when construction will begin or how long it will last. Critics have also raised safety concerns.\nImage\nCredit\nReuters\nSnapshot: Above, bullet trains at a maintenance facility in Guangzhou, China, today before next month\u2019s Lunar New Year celebrations and the accompanying travel rush.\nIn memoriam: Mary Oliver, a Pulitzer Prize-winning poet, used plain language and minute attention to write about the natural world.

Both of the major, multiparty political alliances fell well short of an outright majority in the Parliament in the September elections, and forming a government 133 days later required splitting both blocs.\nThe Social Democrats and Green Party will govern without the third member of their campaign bloc, the Left Party. To consent to the government\u2019s formation, the Center Party and the Liberals broke with the other two members of the center-right alliance they had joined in the campaign.\nIn Sweden, a government does not require majority support in Parliament. But a majority vote can prevent its formation, and an attempt to do that on Friday fell short, with 153 of 349 lawmakers voting to block the new government from taking office.\nAs part of the agreement, the Social Democrats and Greens signed onto a 73-point declaration of intent that is heavy on conservative policies like mandatory language testing to become a citizen, lower taxes and weaker employment protection rules. It also ruled out any influence from the Left Party, the heir to the old Communist Party.\nThe Social Democrats\u2019 bloc on the left won 144 of 349 seats in the election, while the conservative alliance led by the Moderate Party won 143. The nationalist, right-wing Sweden Democrats won 62 seats, by far the best result in the party\u2019s history.\nThat could have put the Sweden Democrats in a position to influence the formation of a government and extract concessions, even if it were not part of the governing coalition.\nThe Liberals and Center Party, which support free-market economics and socially liberal policies, sought to prevent that.\n\u201cWe choose to tolerate this government that can act without support from the Sweden Democrats,\u201d said Annie Loof, leader of the Center Party. \u201cIt\u2019s not our first choice.\u201d\nJimmie Akesson of the Sweden Democrats called the new government \u201cstrange, absurd and bizarre.\u201d\nThe political situation in Sweden has not been so complicated in almost a century, said Torbjorn Larsson, a political scientist at Stockholm University.\nImage\n\u201cThe Center Party and the Liberals have been duped,\u201d said Ulf Kristersson, leader of the Moderate Party.\nCredit\nJonathan Nackstrand/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images\n\u201cUntil now there has been very little cooperation between these two blocs,\u201d Mr. Larsson said. He said that although the government appeared to be weak and unstable, it was likely to survive for a full, four-year term.\nBut voices on the right and the left were highly critical of the deal.\n\u201cThe Center Party and the Liberals have been duped,\u201d said Ulf Kristersson, leader of the Moderate Party, referring to private assurances that Mr. Lofven made to the Left Party. He and Ebba Busch Thor, the leader of the other member of last year\u2019s four-party bloc, the Christian Democrats, declared the alliance dead.\nMs. Busch Thor called the new arrangement \u201can unholy alliance.\u201d\nFormer Prime Minister Carl Bildt, a moderate, wrote on Twitter: \u201cAfter some sort of secret supplementary agreement with the ex-Communists PM L\u00f6fven will be back as PM in Sweden again. And with policies leaning in the other direction. Messy arrangement.\u201d\n\u201cA historic mistake,\u201d a former Left Party politician, Rossana Dinamarca, said on Twitter. \u201cThey have let in a Social Democrat-led right-wing government without getting anything in return.\u201d\nOn Thursday, three longtime Green politicians left the party in protest. One of them, Carl Schlyter, told the public broadcaster SVT that the left bloc would have been more effective in the opposition than peddling a conservative agenda.\n\u201cPeople who are struggling have very few places to turn in this agreement,\u201d he said.\nDaniel Suhonen, the head of Katalys, a trade union research group, said the mix of free-market policies, weakened worker protections and potentially relaxed migration rules could backfire in favor of the Sweden Democrats.\n\u201cWhat you put at risk here is the Social Democratic Party and its historical role of protecting the working class,\u201d Mr. Suhonen said.\nBut Carl Petter Torvaldsson, head of LO, the Swedish Trade Union Confederation, said that in casting their lots with the Social Democrats rather than the Sweden Democrats, the Center Party and the Liberals had sent a strong signal that Sweden stands up to xenophobic parties.\nPolitical analysts said the election and governing agreement show that Sweden\u2019s politics are becoming more like those across Europe, with greater fragmentation, and fights over issues like migration and cultural identity that cut across old ideological lines.\n\u201cThis stable political situation with either the left or the right ruling in Sweden, that time is gone,\u201d he said.\nGoran von Sydow, head of the Swedish Institute for European Policy Studies, an independent research institute, said: \u201cIn the end it was the only workable solution. However, It\u2019s fragile. It\u2019s unorthodox. It breaks with certain elements of Swedish political life.\u201d\nAccording to a poll commissioned by SVT, nearly half of Swedes do not think the government will last the full length of its term.", "html": "<html>\n <body>\n  <div class=\"css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn\">\n   <div class=\"css-4w7y5l\">\n    <p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">\n     <html>\n      <body>\n       <p>\n        STOCKHOLM \u2014 After a deadlock lasting more than four months,\n        <span class=\"pos-link\">\n         Sweden\n        </span>\n        got a new government on Friday, with the Social Democrats and Prime Minister Stefan Lofven holding onto power under an agreement that excludes a right-wing, anti-immigrant party.\n       </p>\n      </body>\n     </html>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">\n     The pact is a precarious one, creating a minority government run by a coalition that had to make concessions to some of its more conservative opponents.

Here\u2019s the sign-up.)\nGood morning.  We\u2019ll be off on Monday for the American holiday of Martin Luther King Day.\nNow, back to the news. The U.S. made plans to expand missile defense, Britain waited for the next move from its prime minister, and President Trump hit back at Nancy Pelosi. Here\u2019s the latest:\nImage\nPresident Trump at the Pentagon.\nCredit\nDoug Mills/The New York Times\nU.S. plans to expand missile defenses\nPresident Trump announced new investments in missile defenses aimed at shielding the nation from missile attacks, though he did not mention the largest U.S. nuclear adversaries, Russia or China.\n\u201cOur strategy is grounded in one overriding objective: to detect and destroy every type of missile attack against any American target, whether before or after launch,\u201d Mr. Trump said at the Pentagon. In fact, the plans released by the Pentagon are aimed largely at destroying small numbers of missiles launched by regional powers like Iran or North Korea, rather than overwhelming strikes from Russia or China.\nBackground: Antimissile systems are extremely costly \u2014 the U.S. has spent more than $300 billion on them to date \u2014 and also extremely difficult to get right. Intercepting speeding targets in the sky is like hitting a bullet with a bullet, and a system introduced in 2004 has failed in 50 percent of tests.\nTiming: The announcement came a day before Vice President Mike Pence is scheduled to meet with North Korea\u2019s lead nuclear program negotiator, Kim Yong-chol, in Washington. Earlier this week, Mr. Pence said the U.S. was still waiting for \u201cconcrete steps from North Korea\u201d toward denuclearization \u2014 a demand that has so far stalled dialogue between the two countries.\nImage\nThe scene outside Parliament in London on Thursday.\nCredit\nNeil Hall/EPA, via Shutterstock\nBritain awaits Theresa May\u2019s Plan B\nThe prime minister has to return to Parliament by Monday with an updated blueprint for Britain\u2019s withdrawal from the E.U. That plan is to go to a vote on Jan. 29.\nDays after Parliament resoundingly rejected her initial Brexit plan, she invited opposition  politicians to discuss a compromise. But the opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn asked her first to rule out a \u201cno-deal\u201d exit. Mrs. May rejected the demand as an \u201cimpossible condition.\u201d\nView from Brussels: E.U. officials initially saw Britain\u2019s growing political crisis as a victory, discouraging other countries from wanting to leave the bloc and contrasting it with the E.U.\u2019s unity. But now it looks increasingly likely that Britain could leave the bloc without a deal, and the E.U. is starting to worry.\nPerspective: British leaders have come under sharp criticism over Brexit. Their failings, the Op-Ed contributor Pankaj Mishra argues, have parallels in the British Empire\u2019s ruinous departure from India.\nImage\nA bus outside the U.S. Capitol on Thursday with a House delegation whose trip to Afghanistan was postponed by President Trump.\nCredit\nSarah Silbiger/The New York Times\nThe president hits back at Nancy Pelosi\nPresident Trump\u2019s squabbling with Democrats grew more acid as the partial government shutdown continued. After Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker, threatened to cancel his planned State of the Union address, Mr. Trump announced on Thursday that he was postponing an overseas trip she had planned that he called a \u201cpublic relations event,\u201d and Washington more and more came to resemble a sandbox filled with children.\nDetails: In a letter dripping with sarcasm, Mr. Trump denied her and her delegation military transport and suggested they might fly commercial. A spokesman for Ms. Pelosi noted that they were planning to travel to Afghanistan, a war zone, to see U.S. forces, and added that Mr. Trump had visited troops in Iraq during the shutdown.\nShutdown: A makeshift national safety net is spreading slowly and unevenly as the longest shutdown in history staggers toward its one-month mark.\nImage\nPresident Aleksandar Vucic of Serbia, right, welcoming his Russian counterpart, Vladimir V. Putin, before talks in Belgrade on Thursday.\nCredit\nMaxim Shipenkov/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images\nPutin visits Serbia as the country adopts his model\nPresident Vladimir Putin of Russia arrived on Thursday in Serbia, a historical Russian ally where his likeness is on everything from mugs to underwear. Serbia\u2019s president, Aleksandar Vucic, welcomed him by busing in tens of thousands of people for a rally. The two announced a big new gas deal, and many who showed up for the events said they were incentivized, including with five liters of milk.\nContext: Serbia is once again a fulcrum of Balkan volatility, and the visit has been a display of what a researcher calls Putin\u2019s orchestra in the country, powered by a growing number of pro-Russia media outlets and nongovernmental groups. But the acoustics are complicated by the fact that Serbia is seeking to join E.U.\nReaction: Tens of thousands of people have been regularly protesting through the winter against Mr. Vucic\u2019s increasingly Putin-like and authoritarian style, and the country\u2019s opposition leader said he feared the E.U. would further overlook his autocratic tendencies in a bid to counter Russia.\nLooking ahead: To join the E.U., Serbia would have to compromise on Kosovo, which Russia and Serbia refuse to recognize, and which Mr. Putin accused of ratcheting up tensions. Mr. Vucic has floated partitioning Kosovo, a risky proposition that John Bolton, President Trump\u2019s national security adviser, has said he\u2019s open to.\nHere\u2019s what else is happening\nJamal Khashoggi: A new book by three Turkish journalists offers the most comprehensive description of the killing of the Saudi dissident in Istanbul last year, drawing on audio recordings obtained by Turkish intelligence officials.\nHitachi: The company said it was suspending work on a $19.3 billion nuclear power plant in North Wales that had been expected to provide hundreds of new local jobs, after the British and Japanese governments failed to agree on financial terms.\nImage\nA window broken after a bomb car bomb exploded on Thursday at a police academy minutes after a promotion ceremony for officers.\nCredit\nMauricio Duenas Castaneda/EPA, via Shutterstock\nColombia: Ten people were killed and 72 wounded by a bombing at a Bogot\u00e1 police academy  that raised the specter of a return to the country\u2019s violent past and came at a time when President Iv\u00e1n Duque, according to a rights group, has been promoting military officers accused of extrajudicial killings.\nFamily separations: The Trump administration most likely separated thousands more children from their parents at the Southern border than was previously believed, according to a report by government inspectors.\nFacebook: The social media company said it deleted nearly 500 pages and accounts related to two disinformation campaigns originating from Russia that targeted users in Eastern Europe and Central Asia.\nMicrosoft: The company pledged $500 million to help address the affordable housing crisis in Seattle, one of a number of cities where the explosive growth of the technology industry has contributed to widening inequality.\nChina: The country is facing its most precipitous population decline in decades, a trend that could have far-reaching economic and political consequences.\nAustralian Open: Simona Halep, Serena Williams and Novak Djokovic advanced to the third round.

These are people whose family and friends are reading your article and experiencing indelible trauma from seeing their loved ones\u2019 photos,\u201d Lorna Kagecha wrote in an email to The Times. \u201cWe do not see this kind of nonsense when you write articles on attacks in the Western world.\u201d\nWhile many social media users blamed our incoming East Africa bureau chief, Kimiko de Freytas-Tamura, for posting the image, she played no role. As with any article, decisions about photography are made by editors in New York or elsewhere, not by reporters.\nThe publication of graphic images is never taken lightly at The Times. Many people across the newsroom are involved in difficult conversations, weighing the desire to be sensitive and respectful of victims and their families with our mission to give readers a clear view of what\u2019s happening in the world.\nTo provide more insight into the decisions behind publishing graphic photos, Meaghan Looram, our director of photography, and Marc Lacey, our National editor and former foreign correspondent based in Nairobi, have answered questions drawn from reader feedback.\nWe welcome you to continue the conversation in the comments section.\nWhat considerations went into choosing the photos in this article? Why did you decide to run the image of dead bodies?\nMEAGHAN LOORAM Let me first say that editors in New York made the decision on which images to publish with the story. Our reporter did not have any input into this decision.\nOur editors always take into consideration the newsworthiness of the story and our responsibility to our readers to honestly convey the events of the world, horrific and disturbing as those events may sometimes be.\nWe look at the universe of images available from any given event, and we try to make a decision that both serves our readers and respects the dignity of those affected by the attack or event.\nGenerally, we try to avoid identifying victims or showing unnecessary blood and gore, particularly if it is not central to the news story that the photograph accompanies.\nBut it is an important part of our role as journalists to document the impact of violence in the world, and if we avoid publishing these types of images, we contribute to obscuring the effects of violence and making debates over security and terrorism bloodless.\nImage\nA burial ceremony on Wednesday in Nairobi, Kenya, for Feisal Ahmed, who was killed in the attack.\nCredit\nAndrew Renneisen/Getty Images\nWe believe that our coverage contributes to national and global discussions on national security, foreign policy, America\u2019s role in international conflicts, gun violence and terror. If we shy away from showing the real consequences of some of these policies, then we are doing our readers, and even those who make some of these policy decisions, a disservice.\nThis year, some of the most disturbing and moving images we published showed starving children in Yemen, a consequence of a yearslong war. Senator Dick Durbin brought an enlarged poster of Tyler Hicks\u2019s photograph of Amal Hussein, a 7-year-old girl who ultimately died of starvation, to the floor of Congress to argue for withdrawal of United States support for this conflict. The Senate later voted to withdraw American aid, the Saudi-led coalition paused its offensive, and peace talks began.\nBut these decisions are always tough.\nMARC LACEY To give you a sense of how difficult these decisions are, there are people in the newsroom who felt in retrospect that we shouldn\u2019t have run the Nairobi photo.\nAt one point early on, the top photo on the article was the one with dead bodies in it. When and why was it changed?\nLOORAM One of the considerations we weigh in publishing images like this is the prominence of the photo\u2019s placement on our platforms and on social media.\nIn this situation, we did not promote the photo on our social media accounts because it was so disturbing. As we listened to our readers\u2019 concerns about the photo, we also decided to move the image to a less prominent position in the article.\nDo you apply the same rules to your reporting on mass shootings in the United States and terrorist attacks in the West as you do to attacks in other parts of the world? Some readers have accused The Times of publishing far fewer graphic images of victims who are white or non-Western.\nLOORAM We do endeavor to apply the same rules to our choice of images from attacks in any part of the world. But these are weighty decisions, considered on a case-by-case basis by individuals.\nIt is important that as journalists, we carefully evaluate whether or not we may be applying any unconscious bias or varying standards to these decisions.\nWe have published images of victims of crime and terror attacks in the United States and other Western countries, including in this article from the Las Vegas shooting and this image from a crime scene in New York City. And here\u2019s one, even further back, from the Oklahoma City bombing.\nOur editors are only dealing with the universe of photographs that are available from any given news event. Press photographers in the United States and other Western countries do not always have the same access to crime scenes as those in the developing world.\nI personally can\u2019t recall having seen any images of victims of school shootings in the United States, so it is difficult to compare the two scenarios.\nLACEY If you go through the archives of The New York Times, you can find a number of photographs that depict dead Americans. They\u2019re there, as Meaghan pointed out. But I do think we can do a better job of having consistent standards that apply across the world.\nThe Times is a global news organization with readers everywhere. Gone are the days in which we can view our audience as an American one. We ought to make our standards decisions without regard to nationality. If we believe a particular type of photograph or article is too sensitive for an American audience, we ought to apply that same standard to a Kenyan audience, and a French one and a Mexican one.\nHow does the fact that more than 70 percent of our audience is in the United States play into our calculations? If we thought we had a mostly Kenyan audience, would we have published the same photo?\nLOORAM Historically, I think that American news organizations did tend to consider only a local or national audience, and thus may have applied different standards to material from locations broadly thought to be remote or \u201cover there,\u201d rather than close to home. I do think that as a global news organization, we must try to let go of this notion and make decisions based on the fact that we serve a global audience.\nLACEY I lived in Kenya for five years, and I have numerous friends who still live there. My immediate thought when I heard of this attack was whether someone I knew might be a victim. For me, this was not some faraway attack. It was a horrible incident in a place I knew well.\nDo we have a consistent policy for the publication of graphic images? If not, are there plans to implement one?\nLACEY As a result of the concerns from our readers that this photo raised, we\u2019re going to convene a group of people to come up with clearer guidelines. I am going to be part of that effort.\nLOORAM The group of journalists Marc is referring to will draft a guide for editors who are faced with making these kinds of consequential decisions.\nAs part of this process, we will create a set of questions to consider before publishing sensitive images. We must weigh our responsibility as journalists to help our readers see and understand the reality of the world with sensitivity to the victims and their families. We take both of these responsibilities very seriously.\nIt is also crucial to me as the director of photography that our editors are cognizant of issues of representation of people of color. We must not apply different standards, or give less consideration, to the dignity and humanity and pain of any group of people.\nWhy We Are Publishing Haunting Photos of Emaciated Yemeni ChildrenOct. 26, 2018\nDepicting, and Respecting, the Dead: Responses to Photos From Mount EverestDec. 21, 2017\nReaders and The Times Respond to Harvey Weinstein\u2019s Page One PortraitDec. 9, 2017\nA note to readers who are not subscribers: This article from the Reader Center does not count toward your monthly free article limit.\nFollow the @ReaderCenter on Twitter for more coverage highlighting your perspectives and experiences and for insight into how we work.", "html": "<html>\n <body>\n  <div class=\"css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn\">\n   <div class=\"css-4w7y5l\">\n    <p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">\n     A\n     <!-- -->\n     <!-- -->\n     <html>\n      <body>\n       <p>\n        photo published by The Times on Tuesday, showing some of the dead victims of an attack in Nairobi,\n        <span class=\"pos-link\">\n         Kenya\n        </span>\n        , led to a swift backlash among some of our readers.\n       </p>\n      </body>\n     </html>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">\n     Many readers thought it was inappropriate to include an image of bloody bodies slumped over tables in our\n     <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/15/world/africa/nairobi-attack.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">\n      article\n     </a>\n     about the assault, which was committed by the Islamic extremist group Shabab.\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">\n     <html>\n      <body>\n       <p>\n        Readers, including many Kenyans, also questioned whether The Times would publish similarly horrific photos after an attack in the\n        <span class=\"pos-link\">\n         United States\n        </span>\n        or elsewhere in the West.\n       </p>\n      </body>\n     </html>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">\n     \u201cThese are not just bodies\n     <!-- -->\n     .\n     <!-- -->\n     These are people whose family and friends are reading your article and experiencing indelible trauma from seeing their loved ones\u2019 photos,\u201d Lorna Kagecha wrote in an email to The Times. \u201cWe do not see this kind of nonsense when you write articles on attacks in the Western world.\u201d\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">\n     While many social media users blamed our incoming East Africa bureau chief, Kimiko de Freytas-Tamura, for posting the image, she played no role.

Russian news services said that she had been detained when she arrived at Sheremetyevo Airport in Moscow.\nCiting a statement from the Interior Ministry, the Russian news services Interfax and RIA Novosti said that three Russian citizens and a female Belarusian citizen, \u201carriving on a flight from the Kingdom of Thailand,\u201d were arrested at the airport on charges of inducement to prostitution.\nIf convicted, the four face up to six years in prison apiece.\nMs. Vashukevich, who also goes by the name Nastya Rybka, was detained in Moscow with her associate Alexander Kirillov, who had helped her conduct a sex-training seminar in the Thai city of Pattaya.\nMr. Kirillov\u2019s wife, Kristina, told reporters at the Moscow airport that Ms. Vashukevich was supposed to have flown on to Minsk, Belarus, Interfax reported.\nThe pair were arrested by the Thai authorities last February after coming under suspicion of working without a permit or visa, and before long Ms. Vashukevich asked for asylum in the United States. She said she could provide more than 16 hours of audio recordings that could shed light on Russian interference in the 2016 American presidential election.\nBy this point, Ms. Vashukevich had already gained a degree of online fame.\nHer Instagram videos of Sergei E. Prikhodko, then a deputy prime minister, and Oleg Deripaska, a billionaire with ties to the Kremlin, were featured prominently in a 25-minute video published by Aleksei A. Navalny, the Russian opposition leader and anticorruption campaigner.\nMs. Vashukevich said she took the photos and audio during a brief affair with Mr. Deripaska, who is also a former business associate of Paul Manafort, President Trump\u2019s onetime campaign chairman. The video released by Mr. Navalny included a recording of Mr. Deripaska and Mr. Prikhodko talking about relations between the United States and Russia.\nAfter her arrest, Ms. Vashukevich expressed fear that the Thai authorities would deport her to Russia, where she had lived before moving to Thailand.\n\u201cI am afraid to go back,\u201d she said at the time. \u201cSome strange things can happen.\u201d\nBut a few months after she tried to bargain for freedom with the United States, Ms. Vashukevich said that she no longer intended to make any material she had public, and had instead sent copies to Mr. Deripaska.\n\u201cNow I just want to wait for Oleg\u2019s answer,\u201d she said last August. \u201cI just want to be friends.\u201d\nAt the Moscow airport on Thursday, Mr. Kirillov\u2019s wife said that Ms. Vashukevich had not changed her mind, according to Interfax.\n\u201cNastya has said it more than once and she can say it again,\u201d she said. \u201cShe\u2019s not ready to share any kind of confidential information. She doesn\u2019t have any kind of compromising files at all.\u201d\nOn Friday, Mr. Navalny posted a video on Twitter that appeared to show Ms. Vashukevich being forcibly detained \u2014 struggling against two men who tried to put her in a wheelchair, and then being dragged into an elevator.

This is what winning looks like.\u201d\nGeneral Funk was standing in a crowded marketplace in Manbij, Syria. He was surveying stalls where vendors not only hawked spices, gold jewelry, olive soap and fresh chicken, but also freely displayed women\u2019s undergarments and brightly colored clothes that the Islamic State banned before it was driven from the city in 2016.\nHe was with a delegation of two United States senators, their staffs and a military escort \u2014 none of whom wore body armor as they walked through the throngs. From the souk, the group strolled to a nearby restaurant, the Palace of Princes, for lunch with local leaders. It was July 2, 2018.\nSix months later, on Wednesday, a suicide bomber detonated his explosive vest outside that same restaurant, killing 15 people, including two American troops, a civilian employee of the Defense Intelligence Agency and a military contractor.\nThe Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack, raising questions about whether American personnel had become lulled into complacency, or if President Trump\u2019s announcement to withdraw American forces had emboldened the extremist group and upset Manbij\u2019s fragile stability.\nImage\nThe site of the suicide bombing targeting American forces in Manbij on Thursday, the day after the attack.\nCredit\nDelil Souleiman/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images\nI was with the delegation that day to write about a planned visit later in the afternoon to wartime prisons elsewhere in northern Syria, where a Kurdish militia was holding Islamic State detainees. But the first stop was Manbij, which the lawmakers wanted to see for other reasons, and I went along for the ride.\nThe delegation was led by two senators on the Armed Services Committee, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire. And while I had no plans to write about Manbij, out of journalistic habit, I took careful notes about what we saw.\nAfter we spent the previous evening at the American Embassy in Baghdad, the military flew us to northern Syria on a C-130 plane. Notably, while we were required to wear body armor whenever we were outside the embassy compound in Iraq, the military did not think such protection was necessary where we were going in Syria.\nAfter a brief stop at a patrol base, a convoy of armored vehicles drove us into Manbij. We went past a boat sculpture on a traffic circle where Islamic State fighters were said to have held public executions before the American-backed Kurdish militia drove the extremists from the city in 2016. The convoy passed through several security perimeters to reach the city center.\nThe scene in Manbij was vibrant, with throngs of people shopping and selling wares with no sense of peril from Islamist terrorism. Instead, the main fear focused on nearby Turkish military forces and whether they might attack to drive the Kurds from the Arab town. The American military was patrolling the area to help keep the peace.\nAfter the marketplace, the group strolled across a plaza that was said to once have been called Jewish Square. Mr. Graham remarked to me that the people of Manbij ought to rename it \u201cTrump Square.\u201d The implication was that that might make Mr. Trump less willing to abandon them.\nImage\nSenator Lindsey Graham at the Palace of Princes restaurant last July.\nCredit\nCharlie Savage/The New York Times\nAt the Palace of Princes restaurant, a favorite of American military advisers, the group walked down a short flight of stairs from the street level to a basement room with small round tables, decorated by tiled walls and paintings and cooled by ceiling fans.\nThere, waiters brought bottles of water and small cups of coffee along with seemingly endless waves of food \u2014 kebabs, chicken shawarma, yogurt, hummus, salads and many other delicacies. Over the food, the Americans met with the heads of the Manbij city council and other local leaders, who were working on a new constitution and laws, along with Kurdish militia leaders.\nThe Manbij residents talked about life under the Islamic State \u2014 the shuttering of schools, the forced dress code of black, the pervasive fear that kept people walking and speaking \u201clike robots.\u201d They made pitches for funding for things like fixing up a hospital where a dialysis machine and other equipment had been looted by the extremists.\nOne resident, Shikh Khalif, said he had owned a car dealership before the Syrian civil war began in 2011, and was now the leader of the New Syria Party, which formed last March. Mr. Graham asked him what his platform was, and why people should vote for him.\n\u201cMy hands are clean,\u201d Mr. Khalif said through a translator. \u201cI had no hand in killing people.\u201d\n\u201cPretty good,\u201d Mr. Graham said. \u201cNo corruption, no killing \u2014 goes a long way.\u201d He then asked what would happen if the United States were to leave Manbij.\nMr. Khalif replied that perhaps the Islamic State would return, or perhaps the region would fall under the control of the government of Syria\u2019s president, Bashar al-Assad, or even be occupied by the Turkish military.\n\u201cIt would be chaos,\u201d Mr. Khalif said.\nWhen the lunch was over, the American group thanked the restaurant\u2019s staff and walked back up the stairs to the sidewalk, preparing to take the convoy back out of town. But first, Mr. Graham and several of the people at the lunch posed, smiling for a photo.\nThey stood on the same spot that was transformed into a scene of carnage this week.\nAs ISIS Fighters Fill Prisons in Syria, Their Home Nations Look AwayJuly 18, 2018\nI\u2019ve Been Covering the Detention of Terrorism Suspects for 15 Years.

Visiting officials were welcomed to red booths and water pipes; two American senators dined there in July.\n\u201cThey stop here for chicken and shawarma whenever they have a patrol in the city,\u201d said Jassim al-Khalaf, 37, who sells vegetables nearby. \u201cPeople here are used to it, so it\u2019s not a new thing to see them.\u201d\nThe jihadists of the Islamic State noticed, too, dispatching a suicide bomber who blew himself up at the restaurant on Wednesday, killing at least 15 people, including four Americans: two service members, a Defense Department civilian and a military contractor.\nThat attack, in a Syrian town celebrated as an American-backed island of stability, raised troubling questions about whether the American military had developed a false sense of security in a conflict zone, where avoiding predictable routines like a regular lunch spot can be a matter of life and death.\nSeveral current and former Special Operations personnel, as well as other American officials who had worked in the region, said Thursday that the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, had exploited a vulnerability.\n\u201cISIS saw a target of opportunity, but they should have had better force protection,\u201d a Special Operations officer said, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the news media.\nA former senior officer, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Islamic State \u201cwill attack Americans anywhere and anytime they sense an opportunity.\u201d\nThe officials acknowledged that the dead and wounded, who included at least one Green Beret, had grown complacent and should have varied their patrol routes or increased their operational security.\n\u201cThe illusion of safety has always been a problem in northeast Syria,\u201d said one American official working in the region.\nIt was an easy lapse to fall into in Manbij, a small city in northeastern Syria near the border with Turkey. An American-led Kurdish-Arab coalition drove the Islamic State out of the city in mid-2016 and set up American-backed local councils who ran the place.\nAfter Turkey threatened to invade early last year to drive out Kurdish forces, which Turkey considers terrorist, the United States started running patrols from bases in the olive groves near town to keep one ally, Turkey, from attacking another, the Kurds.\nThe military presence made Manbij deceptively peaceful.\nOn a July visit, a delegation of American military leaders and senators wore no body armor as they walked through a crowded marketplace there, surveying stalls hawking spices, gold jewelry, olive soap and fresh chicken.\n\u201cPretty cool,\u201d said Lt. Gen. Paul E. Funk II, then the commander of coalition forces fighting in Iraq and Syria, \u201cThis is what stability looks like. This is what winning looks like.\u201d\nFrom there, the group, including Senators Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, and Jeanne Shaheen, Democrat of New Hampshire, strolled to the Palace of Princes for lunch with local leaders.\n\u201cWe had a very good tour and a terrific lunch,\u201d Senator Graham said afterward. Manbij, he said, was \u201ca place of hope in a region that needs more hope.\u201d\nThe restaurant\u2019s owner, Ali Saleh al-Yousef, also saw Manbij as a bright spot in a war-ravaged country.\nIn a recent local TV interview, he said that he left the city when the Islamic State took over and returned only once it was safe again.\n\u201cWe wish all the provinces in Syria could be like Manbij,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause now Manbij has become an example.\u201d\nImage\nSenator Lindsey Graham, center, dined at the Palace of Princes restaurant in July. He had \u201ca terrific lunch,\u201d he said.\nCredit\nCharlie Savage/The New York Times\nA two-story restaurant on a crowded downtown street, the Palace of Princes served meat grilled over charcoal, rotisserie chicken, shawarma and other dishes that made it a favorite stop for American soldiers on patrol.\nSometimes they would drop in to get sandwiches to go before rumbling back to their bases outside of town, residents said. Other times, they would park their armored vehicles in front and get a table.\nIf the Americans gave any thought to the cardinal importance of varying one\u2019s routines in a war zone to make it harder for enemies to plan attacks, it was not reflected in their eating habits.\n\u201cI know that whenever they went to the city because there was a patrol or a mission, they\u2019d pass by that restaurant,\u201d said Shervan Darwish, the spokesman for the Manbij Military Council, which works closely with the United States.\nOn Wednesday, one such patrol dropped in for a late lunch. Cars were double-parked in front of the restaurant and the sidewalks were full of people visiting the nearby vegetable market, according to residents and surveillance footage posted online.\nA suicide bomber mixed into the crowd and detonated his explosive vest near the restaurant entrance. A fireball erupted in front of the restaurant, yanking down its sign, toppling the rotisserie and leaving the dead and wounded scattered in the street, according to witnesses and videos posted online.\n\u201cWe saw civilians on the ground, kids, soldiers, fire still blazing in the shop,\u201d Ahmed Himo, a local journalist, said by phone on Thursday. \u201cIt was a terrible scene.\u201d\nAhmad Sulaiman, 12, was passing the restaurant on the way to his grandfather\u2019s house when the blast happened.\n\u201cWhen I passed, there was the man who makes the shawarma sandwiches,\u201d Ahmad said while being treated for leg injuries in a hospital. \u201cThen fire flashed and disappeared and the man was no longer there.\u201d\nWhile rescue workers rushed the wounded to the hospital, three helicopters appeared in the sky, Mr. Himo said. One tried to land in the street but it was too narrow, so it landed on a soccer field nearby. The dead and wounded Americans were taken there and flown away.\nOn Friday the Pentagon identified three of the Americans who were killed as Chief Warrant Officer Jonathan R. Farmer, 37, of Boynton Beach, Fla., a Special Forces soldier, or Green Beret; Chief Cryptologic Technician Shannon M. Kent, 35, of New York State, who was in the Navy; and Scott A. Wirtz, a Defense Intelligence Agency civilian employee, of St. Louis, Mo.\nThree other service members were wounded and flown to an American military hospital in Germany for treatment, a military official said.\nUntil this week, just two American service members had been killed in Syria.\nAllied aircraft bombed a mosque on Thursday that the Islamic State had used as a command center in Safafiyah, Syria, in the Middle Euphrates River Valley, the Pentagon said. It was unclear if the airstrike was in response to the attack in Manbij, scores of miles to the northwest, or, more likely, a target of opportunity.\nManbij was still in shock on Thursday, residents said, struggling to deal with the aftermath of the bombing and their town\u2019s uncertain future should Mr. Trump make good on his promise to withdraw American troops. Turkey has talked about invading. The Syrian government and its Russian and Iranian allies want the territory back. And the Islamic State has proved it still has the ability to strike.\nThe attack added fuel to the debate over the ever-shifting American mission in eastern Syria, and President Trump\u2019s plans to bring troops home.\nWhile Mr. Trump and, as recently as Wednesday, Vice President Mike Pence, insisted that the Islamic State had been defeated, a range of American officials, including many of Mr. Trump\u2019s allies, have said the attack proved otherwise and that leaving Syria could allow the jihadists to come roaring back.\nMr. Darwish, of the local military council, said that whether the United States ultimately withdraws or not, the existing confusion over American policy had emboldened the jihadists.\n\u201cISIS benefits from the tense atmosphere, the murky situation, the recent statements, the decision to withdraw and the tweets from all over,\u201d he said. \u201cThat has made the region unstable, and all of that helps ISIS to bring itself back together.\u201d\nHe said that an American withdrawal would leave a vacuum that the jihadists would be well positioned to exploit.\n\u201cISIS will benefit,\u201d he said.\nBut the deaths, in a part of Syria few Americans have heard of, also drew calls to remove the United States from another murky Middle Eastern battlefield.\n\u201cThe real danger is that these attacks will lead Trump and company to bow to the pressure of the Syria Washington hawks who are already saying that unless America stays, it will be portrayed as weak,\u201d said Aaron David Miller, a former Middle East analyst at the State Department. \u201cThis is a prescription for another forever war.\u201d", "html": "<html>\n <body>\n  <div class=\"css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn\">\n   <div class=\"css-4w7y5l\">\n    <p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">\n     <html>\n      <body>\n       <p>\n        BEIRUT \u2014 For American troops posted in the dusty flatlands of northern\n        <span class=\"pos-link\">\n         Syria\n        </span>\n        , the Palace of the Princes restaurant in Manbij offered a pleasant place to stop for grilled chicken, French fries or its locally renowned shawarma sandwich.\n       </p>\n      </body>\n     </html>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">\n     The Americans liked the food so much that they dropped in frequently, often many times a week, residents said.

Sign up to get it by email.\n___\nI\n\u2019m in Hong Kong this week for our annual meeting with New York Times editors and correspondents from all across Asia, and on the plane over I was reading Evan Osnos\u2019s book, \u201cAge of Ambition: Chasing Fortune, Truth, and Faith in the New China.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a fascinating read, far more about people than geopolitics (read our 2014 review), making it a strong introduction to some of the themes that many of us will continue to inquire about as the world grapples with China\u2019s growing impact.\nSome of the questions are almost existential: Has China proved that centralized authoritarianism works better for economic growth than decentralized democracy?\nOthers are more particular: How is China using technology to maintain and expand its power? How will China respond to the growing backlash to its policies forming in Australia, the United States and elsewhere?\nThese reporting targets, we hope, will yield interesting journalism throughout the year.\nBut our discussions in Hong Kong also covered the region. We have correspondents throughout Asia, reporting on politics, culture, business and technology; here are a few of the topics that led to robust conversations about our future coverage.\nThis is far from a comprehensive list, but consider it a bit of a preview for 2019.\nElections: India, the Philippines, Thailand \u2014 and Australia of course \u2014 all have elections scheduled for this year. Voters will be given stark choices about not just domestic policy, but also foreign affairs.\nDemographics: India has to create a million jobs each year to keep unemployment from rising; Japan is desperate for workers; China is desperate for babies. There are also intriguing stories about South Korea\u2019s aging populace, Australia\u2019s immigration debate and China\u2019s broader population dynamics \u2014 especially its overabundance of men.\nWomen: The role of women in the work force and in life, in Japan, in China, in Australia \u2014 these were all of interest to the group. What are the structures that maintain the status quo, how do they differ from country to country, and to what extent are they changing?\nTrump\u2019s world: Ah, the Americans \u2014 what an unpredictable lot! What many of us in the Indo-Pacific wanted to know is what the broader shift toward \u201cAmerica first\u201d means for the world. To what extent will the American relationship with South Korea and North Korea change? To what extent will the United States-China trade war undermine the global economy or create new relationships and alliances?\nThese are just a few of the subjects you\u2019ll see explored in The New York Times this year \u2014 and of course, in this newsletter, which aims to add a bit of perspective on Australia and the topics Australians care about.\nSign up to get it in your inbox each week if you haven\u2019t already, and join us in our NYT Australia Facebook group for additional discussion.\nNow here are a few of the stories that stood out for me this week, from Australia, Vanuatu and beyond.\n___\nWhere Do We Come From?\nImage\nA skull found at a prehistoric burial site near Teouma Bay, on the island nation of Vanuatu.\nCredit\nDavid Maurice Smith for The New York Times\n\u201cA faint aura of destiny seems to hover over Teouma Bay,\u201d writes Gideon Lewis-Kraus, in this ambitious magazine story told from Vanuatu about old bones that have led to sweeping claims about human history and settlement throughout the Pacific.\nGideon brilliantly explains both the controversial science that\u2019s transforming archaeology \u2014 and the risks that come from the perception of scientific certainty about ancient history.\nIf you read just one long story this week, read this one.\nFor those seeking a shorter way in, here are 5 takeaways from his report.\n___\nThe Brexit Fiasco\nImage\nPrime Minister Theresa May listening as the opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn spoke on Wednesday.\nCredit\nMark Duffy/Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images\nFollowing Brexit\u2019s ups and downs can be exhausting. For context, read this news analysis piece that explains how the Brexit fiasco \u201cseems to be forcing a tectonic shift in how Britain is governed, as Parliament flexes its muscles and the prime minister struggles to force through her agenda \u2014 a dynamic more characteristic of America\u2019s gridlock-prone system.\u201d\nYou might also want to check out our graphic on what happens next (or at least what might happen next; certaintly eludes us all).\n___\nGlaciers: Going, Going, Gone\nImage\nA shrinking glacier in Kazakhstan.\nSometimes global failure can be so... visually stunning.\nSeriously. Check out this stunning exploration of the world\u2019s disappearing glaciers.\nThey cover about 200,000 square miles of the earth\u2019s surface and over the last four decades they\u2019ve lost the equivalent of a layer of ice 70 feet thick.\nThis great global melting contributes to sea level rise. It affects production of hydroelectricity. It leads to disasters like rapid, catastrophic floods and debris flows. It alters rivers and ecosystems, affecting the organisms that inhabit them.\n___\nThe Tennis\nImage\nSerena Williams, practicing for the Australian Open this week, arrived in Melbourne still at the center of debate and discussion over race, gender and sports.\nCredit\nMichael Dodge/Getty Images\nWe have several reporters at the Australian Open.

She has continued to push her case for a delay, and also hinted that Democrats would begin promoting their own proposals for border security.\nAnd as the shutdown continues, ordinary Americans are creating a makeshift national safety net for furloughed workers that is spreading slowly and unevenly across the United States.\n_____\nImage\nCredit\nMark Wright/Missile Defense Agency, via Associated Press\n2. At the Pentagon, President Trump called for new investments in missile defenses aimed at shielding the U.S. from the increasingly sophisticated weaponry in North Korea, China, Russia and Iran.\nAntimissile systems are extremely costly \u2014 the U.S. has spent over $300 billion on them to date \u2014 and also extremely difficult to get right. It has proved challenging to intercept speeding targets in the sky: A system introduced in 2004 has failed in 50 percent of its tests.\nOn Friday, Vice President Mike Pence is scheduled to meet with North Korea\u2019s lead nuclear program negotiator in Washington. Mr. Pence said this week that the U.S. was still waiting for \u201cconcrete steps from North Korea\u201d toward denuclearization \u2014 a demand that has stalled dialogue between the two countries.\n_____\nImage\nCredit\nVictor J.

Thousands more migrant children were likely separated from their families than officially reported.\nAs of December, nearly 3,000 children were known to have been forcibly separated from their parents under last year\u2019s \u201czero-tolerance\u201d immigration policy, in which nearly all adults entering the U.S. illegally were prosecuted and any children with them were put into shelters or foster care. Above, a father and daughter reunited in Phoenix this summer.\nBut a new report from a branch of the Department of Health and Human Services notes that thousands more children may have been separated during an influx that began in 2017, before a federal court order required them to be tracked.\n_____\nImage\nCredit\nVia Associated Press\n4. A car bomb exploded at a police academy in Bogot\u00e1, the capital of Colombia, killing at least 10 people and wounding 72.\nThe attack sent shock waves across the city, where bombings were once common as drug traffickers and leftist guerrillas waged aggressive terror campaigns. But it has been years since there was an attack of this kind in Bogot\u00e1.\nNo group immediately claimed responsibility.\n_____\nImage\nCredit\nAntonio Perez\n5. Three Chicago police officers were acquitted of charges that they covered up for the officer who fatally shot Laquan McDonald, a black teenager, in 2014.\nThe officers\u2019 accounts of the encounter \u2014 including saying Laquan tried to stab officers \u2014 were contradicted by video from a police dashboard camera. But the judge said the state had failed to prove its case.\nThe verdict was a blow to those who saw an opportunity to exact accountability in a city where the police have been accused for decades of a maintaining a \u201ccode of silence\u201d regarding misconduct.\nJason Van Dyke, the officer who shot Laquan 16 times, was convicted of second-degree murder in October and is to be sentenced on Friday.\n_____\nImage\nCredit\nMaheder Haileselassie/Reuters\n6. The environmental risks of climate change are clear and tangible. But what about its impact on the economy?\nOn Thursday, some of the world\u2019s most influential economists called for a tax on carbon emissions in the United States, saying climate change demands \u201cimmediate national action.\u201d Proceeds from the tax, they suggested, would be distributed to consumers as \u201ccarbon dividends.\u201d\nAbove, sorting coffee beans in Ethiopia. The plant is seeing the negative impact of global warming.\nThe proposal comes on the heels of a government report that raised the prospect that a warmer planet could mean a big hit to G.D.P. in the coming decades. Much of it comes down to how to value the future versus the present, our senior economics correspondent explains.\n_____\nImage\nCredit\nDavid Maurice Smith for The New York Times\n7. What can genes tell us about who we are?\nIn a handful of elite labs around the world, geneticists have begun using old bones to try to answer fundamental questions about the human past.\nIn an extensive report, The Times Magazine looks at whether these \u201cpaleogenomics\u201d studies are revealing new truths or falling into old traps \u2014 like reviving the kind of grand narratives once exploited by extreme nationalists like the Nazis to tell stories about their people\u2019s glorious pasts.\nWe also have five takeaways from our long read.\n_____\nImage\nCredit\nAngel Valentin for The New York Times\n8. When it\u2019s over, I want to say all my life/\nI was a bride married to amazement./\nI was the bridegroom, taking the world into my arms./\nMary Oliver, a Pulitzer Prize-winning poet, died at her home in Hobe Sound, Fla. She was 83.\nTributes to her poured out on social media. Here\u2019s our obituary.\n_____\nImage\nCredit\nThe Ansel Adams Publishing Rights Trust, via Museum of Fine Arts, Boston\n9. The National Parks may be affected by the government shutdown, but the American wilderness shines in a new photography show.\n\u201cAnsel Adams in Our Time,\u201d at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, is a far-ranging exhibition that connects the legendary conservationist to 23 contemporary photographers. Above, \u201cThe Tetons and Snake River, Grand Teton National Park, Wyoming,\u201d by Mr. Adams in 1942.\nBy including newer works, our critic writes, the show \u201chighlights how Adams, who carried the 19th century\u2019s hymn to America into the 20th century, has remained an inescapable force.\u201d\n_____\nImage\nCredit\nJohnathon Kelso for The New York Times\n10. Finally, it\u2019s a garage sale like no other.\nMany people might struggle to imagine liking an airline so much they\u2019d want to buy its old silverware and service carts. But at a monthly sale, lovers of Delta Air Lines snap up decommissioned items.\nBuyers line up at the airline\u2019s flight museum in Atlanta to get their hands on bottles of cocktail syrup and slippers \u2014 even old airplane parts. At a recent sale, a set of first-class seats sold for $300 (economy was available for $250).\nMany return again and again. \u201cIt\u2019s never the same sale twice,\u201d one shopper said.\nHave a thrifty night.\n_____\nYour Evening Briefing is posted at 6 p.m. Eastern.\nAnd don\u2019t miss Your Morning Briefing.

The factories and their operations were discovered through a painstaking digital examination of open-source data.\n\u201cNorth Korea may be reluctant to share those locations precisely to make them harder to target,\u201d Jeffrey Lewis, an expert on North Korea at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in Monterey, Calif., said in a report published Thursday. \u201cIn other cases, however, the visits may have been related to the development of new missile-related systems that North Korea was not yet prepared to reveal.\u201d\nThe report about the sites comes as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo prepares to meet North Korea\u2019s nuclear negotiator, Kim Yong-chol, to discuss steps toward denuclearization in the North that could lay the groundwork for a second meeting between President Trump and Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader.\nImage\nMr. Kim visited another so-called machine plant in Panghyon in northwest North Korea in 2014 and 2015. When he visited the area again in July 2017, the North Korean leader watched the launch of the Hwasong-14.\nCredit\nMiddlebury Institute of International Studies\nDr. Lewis worked with his colleague, David Schmerler, often matching videos and photographs released by the North Korean state news media with commercial satellite imagery and details from visits by North Korean leaders to known factory sites. Their report included map coordinates for the six plants, three of which turned out to be next to sites of important missile tests overseen by Mr. Kim.\nSince he took power in 2011, Mr. Kim has rapidly accelerated his country\u2019s missile program, which culminated in a series of test flights of its Hwasong-14 and Hwasong-15 long-range missiles in 2017, some of them believed to be capable of reaching North America. Mr. Kim did so while frequently visiting weapons-related facilities, inspecting tests and feting officials and engineers involved in weapons development with parades, gala parties and heroes\u2019 titles.\nFollowing its last test of the Hwasong-15 intercontinental ballistic missile, conducted in November 2017, Mr. Kim announced a moratorium on nuclear and long-range missile tests, saying North Korea no longer needed them because it had completed its nuclear deterrent.\nAt his meeting with Mr. Trump last June in Singapore, Mr. Kim vowed to work toward the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula if Washington met his conditions, such as lifting sanctions and providing security guarantees for North Korea. In a New Year\u2019s Day speech this year, Mr. Kim indicated that his country was no longer making nuclear weapons.\nBut while he is engaged in diplomacy, Mr. Kim has yet to announce a timetable for dismantling his nuclear arsenal. Instead, his country is still operating its missile bases and is suspected of continuing to improve its missile capabilities, despite Mr. Trump\u2019s claims of progress in efforts to denuclearize the North.\nImage\nA machine plant making integrated circuits in Pyongyang, the capital, was visited by Mr. Kim three times from 2013 to 2016 and was described by the North Korean news media as \u201ca nice plant in a park.\u201d North Korea may well have chosen to obscure the location because of fears it would be a target for cyberattacks.\nCredit\nMiddlebury Institute of International Studies\nThe work by Dr. Lewis and Mr. Schmerler helps unveil the secretive nature of the North Korean missile program. United States intelligence officials believed some of the plants produced armored vehicles, light aircraft, machine tools or textiles. But until now, their probable links to the North\u2019s missile program had not been publicized.\nFrom 2012 to 2016, Mr. Kim made five publicized visits to what the North Korean state news media identified as a machine plant \u201cmanaged by Ho Chol-yong\u201d in northwest North Korea that was undergoing a significant expansion, Dr. Lewis and Mr. Schmerler said.\nAccording to their research, North Korea actually used this location to launch its Pukguksong-2 missile in February 2017. The test marked a major leap forward for the North because the medium-range ballistic missile used solid fuel, which makes it easier to hide, transport and launch and harder for the United States to target in a pre-emptive strike.\nThe test was dramatic enough at the time that aides to Mr. Trump and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan interrupted their dinner at the Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida to bring them early reports of the launch.\nNorth Korea also used the location to flight-test its Hwasong-12 intermediate-range ballistic missile in May 2017, another major stride for the North\u2019s missile program. The plant is now believed to be involved in the development of tracked launch vehicles for missiles, Dr. Lewis and Mr. Schmerler said.\nImage\nOne factory located by the researchers was believed to have two campuses, with the underground portion hidden near a textile plant.\nCredit\nMiddlebury Institute of International Studies\nMr. Kim visited another machine plant, supposedly \u201cmanaged by Jon Tong-ryol,\u201d in Panghyon in northwest North Korea in 2014 and 2015. When he visited the area again in July 2017, the North Korean leader watched the launch of the Hwasong-14, the country\u2019s first major test of an intercontinental ballistic missile, which Mr. Kim at the time mockingly called his Fourth of July \u201cgift\u201d for Mr. Trump.\nIn their report, Dr. Lewis and Mr. Schmerler also located a machine plant said to be managed by Ri Chol-ho in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, that makes integrated circuits. Mr. Kim visited there three times from 2013 to 2016 and the North Korean state news media has described it as \u201ca nice plant in a park.\u201d\nNorth Korea may well have chosen to obscure the location because of fears that a factory producing integrated circuits, crucial for space and missile applications, would be a target for American cyberattacks, the researchers said.\nThe Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the report\u2019s findings.\nNorth Korea keeps many of its weapons-related facilities underground to protect them from outside monitoring or attacks in case of war.\nOne factory Dr. Lewis and Mr. Schmerler located was believed to have two campuses, with the underground portion hidden near a textile plant. They learned that the North Korean state news media used different names when Mr. Kim visited the aboveground and underground facilities there, Dr. Lewis said by email.\n\u201cIn some cases, Kim was visiting factories that are largely located underground and the effort was likely an effort to keep the location of the underground plant a secret,\u201d he said.", "html": "<html>\n <body>\n  <div class=\"css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn\">\n   <div class=\"css-4w7y5l\">\n    <p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">\n     Over the years, outside analysts have closely followed visits by North Korean leaders to factories, farms and military units to discern the regime\u2019s policy priorities.\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">\n     The sleuthing is challenging: The North Korean state news media often withhold the locations of these sites and their purposes, identifying them only by the names of their managers.\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">\n     <html>\n      <body>\n       <p>\n        Now, two analysts based in the\n        <span class=\"pos-link\">\n         United States\n        </span>\n        have located six such factories believed to be linked to North Korea\u2019s missile program, visits to which by the country\u2019s leaders were deliberately obscured by the state news media to thwart Washington\u2019s intelligence-gathering or cyberattacks.

The book, \u201cDiplomatic Atrocity: The Dark Secrets of the Jamal Khashoggi Murder,\u201d is written in Turkish and went on sale in December.\nSaudi officials have offered changing accounts of what happened to Mr. Khashoggi, who had gone to the consulate to pick up documents he needed to get married. At first, they claimed he had left the consulate building safely after an appointment there. Later, they said he had died in a struggle. Eventually, they said he had been killed and dismembered.\nThe kingdom says it has detained 18 people in the case, and 11 people were charged in Riyadh, the kingdom\u2019s capital, this month.\nThe book does not explain how the Turkish government obtained the recordings. But it does say that Turkish intelligence officials had gathered audio recordings from several locations in the consulate. Excerpts were later played for senior officials and their foreign counterparts, including Gina Haspel, director of the C.I.A.\nThe reporters identify one of the officials on the tapes as Maher Abdulaziz Mutreb, a security official and frequent companion of the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman. Mr. Mutreb is heard giving orders and directing the conversation with Mr. Khashoggi, the book says.\nTurkish officials identified Mr. Mutreb and others through sound analysis, the reporters write.\nThey say it was Mr. Mutreb who laid out the plan to Salah al-Tubaigy, a top forensic official of the Saudi government, telling him they would try to take Mr. Khashoggi back to Saudi Arabia. If Mr. Khashoggi resisted, \u201cWe will kill him here and get rid of the body,\u201d Mr. Mutreb told Mr. Tubaigy, according to the book.\nImage\nKing Salman of Saudi Arabia and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman meeting with Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s sons in Riyadh in October.\nCredit\nSaudi Press Agnecy\n\u201cJamal is tall, around 1.80 meters,\u201d Mr. Tubaigy is quoted as saying. \u201cThe joints of a sacrificial animal are easily split, but dismembering still will take time.\u201d\n\u201cI always worked on cadavers,\u201d he said. \u201cI know how to cut well. I have never worked on a warm body until now, but I can handle that easily. Normally while working on a cadaver, I put on my headphones and listen to music. And I drink my coffee and smoke my cigarette.\u201d\n\u201cAfter I dismember, you will wrap them in plastic bags and put in the luggage and take\u201d the body parts out, Mr. Tubaigy added.\nWithin minutes of entering the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul, Mr. Khashoggi was taken to the consul\u2019s office. \u201cLet go of my arm \u2014 what do you think you are doing?\u201d he is heard saying.\n\u201cAs soon as Mr. Khashoggi entered the room,\u201d the reporters write, \u201cMr. Mutreb told him: \u2018Come, sit down. We came to take you to Riyadh.\u2019 Khashoggi\u2019s answer was short and clear: \u2018I won\u2019t go to Riyadh.\u2019\u201d\nThe Saudi team wanted Mr. Khashoggi to send the following message to his son Salah: \u201cMy son, I am in Istanbul. Do not worry if you don\u2019t hear from me for a while.\u201d Mr. Khashoggi refused, and Mr. Mutreb ordered his men to set out the tools they had brought to dismember his body, the book says. The audio captures the sound of the instruments being placed on a table.\nImage\nStills from security footage showing Mr. Khashoggi, left, arriving at the consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2, and someone apparently acting as his body double on Oct. 10.\nCredit\nSabah Daily Newspaper, via Agence France-Presse \u2014 Getty Images\n\u201cAre you going to kill me? Are you going to strangle me?\u201d Mr. Khashoggi is heard asking. Mr. Mutreb told him he would be \u201cforgiven\u201d if he cooperated, the reporters say.\nMr. Mutreb then orders five Saudi agents to jump on Mr. Khashoggi.\nOne of the agents, who the book says was \u201cmost probably Thaar Ghaleb al-Harbi,\u201d tried to cover Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s mouth, but the audio suggests that Mr. Khashoggi fended him off, the reporters say.\nMr. Harbi is among the Saudi royal guard and was promoted last year to the rank of lieutenant for bravery in the defense of Prince Mohammed\u2019s palace in Jidda. The book says the group also included Mohammed Saad Alzahrani, another royal guard.\nThe killers finally managed to put a plastic bag over Mr. Khashoggi\u2019s head, the book says. It took five minutes until he drew his last breath, and his last words were recorded as: \u201cDo not cover my mouth. I have asthma. Don\u2019t, you will strangle me.\u201d\nMr. Khashoggi died at 1:24 p.m., the book reports, just 10 minutes after entering the building.\n\u201cThe last seconds in the consulate passed with the rasping of the victim who was about to give a farewell to this world,\u201d the reporters write.\nAfter Mr. Khashoggi was dead, Mustafa al-Madani, the Saudi who was sent to be a double of Mr. Khashoggi, and Saif Saad al-Qahtani removed his clothes, the book says. Mr. Harbi and Mr. Zahrani helped Mr. Tubaigy as he dismembered the body, the book says, describing the forensics expert as raining down orders on people around him. \u201cWhat are you waiting for?\u201d he yelled.\nAs the scene unfolded, consulate personnel felt sick, the book says.\n\u201cAccording to the audio,\u201d the reporters write, \u201cthe chop-chop that was heard now and then established the use of a tool similar to a chopping knife during the dismembering of the bones of the body, while a high-pitched sound of an electric autopsy saw, working frequently, was also recorded.\u201d", "html": "<html>\n <body>\n  <div class=\"css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn\">\n   <div class=\"css-4w7y5l\">\n    <p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">\n     ISTANBUL \u2014 A new book written by three Turkish reporters and drawing on audio recordings of the killing of a Saudi expatriate, Jamal Khashoggi, offers new details about an encounter that began with a demand that he return home and ended in murder and dismemberment.\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">\n     \u201cFirst we will tell him \u2018We are taking you to Riyadh,\u2019\u201d one member of a Saudi hit team told another, the book claims. \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t come, we will kill him here and get rid of the body.\u201d\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">\n     <html>\n      <body>\n       <p>\n        Turkish officials have cited the recordings, saying they captured the death of Mr. Khashoggi, a journalist, in his Oct. 2 visit to the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul.

But the scope of the extreme weather remained impressive, with precipitation falling from southeast Missouri to upstate New York.\nIn Alabama, a tornado tore through the roughly 8,000-person town of Wetumpka, about 15 miles northeast of Montgomery. Images of the devastation showed the rumpled remains of homes and churches, and Jerry Willis, the mayor, told local reporters that one \u201csenior citizens center\u201d was destroyed.\n\u201cWe were not expecting anything like this,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s taken a toll on us.\u201d\nImage\nRescue workers checking damaged structures after a tornado in Wetumpka, Ala., on Saturday. The mayor said the storm caused significant damage to the city\u2019s downtown.\nCredit\nMickey Welsh/The Montgomery Advertiser, via Associated Press\nSome areas of New York, south of upstate and closer to the coast, were expected to get a wintry cocktail of snow, sleet, rain and ice, followed by plummeting temperatures.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a complicated storm,\u201d said Rich Otto, a National Weather Service meteorologist, who said the \u201ckitchen sink\u201d of mixed precipitation was caused by a combination of cold air moving down from Canada and low pressure coming in from the south.\nThe storm continued to move briskly and was not expected to linger in the Northeast. Mr. Otto said he expected the worst to move past New York City, where only two or three inches were forecast, by Sunday morning. In New England, the storm was expected to pass by Sunday night.\nAs with any storm, National Weather Service offices across the country were busy providing detailed forecasts and updates. But this time their meteorologists were doing it without pay, a casualty of the federal government shutdown.\n\u201cThere\u2019s definitely a drain on morale,\u201d said Ray Martin, a senior meteorologist in the Weather Service office serving Washington and Baltimore. He said he knew colleagues with young children or a new house who were struggling. \u201cThere\u2019s a little bit of not feeling appreciated,\u201d he added.\nThough the snowstorm was not exactly surprising \u2014 it is January, after all \u2014 its impact has proved frightening, especially on transportation.\nA United Airlines plane slid off a concrete surface at O\u2019Hare International Airport in Chicago on Saturday, while the plane was turning off a runway. Airline officials said no injuries were reported.\nThe night before, at Eppley Airfield in Omaha, a Southwest Airlines plane slid off the runway after landing. After a bumpy descent, the plane seemed to be coming in sideways just before touching down, said Benny Salz, a passenger on the flight. It hit the ground hard, fishtailed and slid into the grass just off the runway, said Mr. Salz, 30, a music producer and singer who lives in Los Angeles.\n\u201cPeople were definitely freaked out when we landed,\u201d he said.\nRoad conditions were also nasty. Two people died in Kohler, Wis., on Friday night after a car they were riding in slid off a slick, snow-covered interstate and struck a tree, the local police said. In Kansas, the state Department of Transportation said one of its drivers died Saturday morning in a crash south of Kansas City.\nImage\nCyclists in Madison, Wis., braved a snowstorm that is sweeping through the Northern United States.\nCredit\nSteve Apps/Wisconsin State Journal, via Associated Press\nOfficials urged drivers to take precautions. In Missouri, the Transportation Department said \u201croads continue to be slick\u201d and \u201cfolks are still driving too fast for the current conditions.\u201d In New York, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo banned tractor-trailers and buses on most interstates for the duration of the storm. And in Rhode Island, state troopers warned that residents might encounter icy roads if they left home to watch on television as the Kansas City Chiefs host the New England Patriots on Sunday night.\n\u201cIf there is ever a weekend to stay in and binge-watch something, this may be it,\u201d said Gov. Phil Murphy of New Jersey, who declared a state of emergency starting at noon Saturday.\nMore than 2,000 flights were canceled across the country on Saturday, according to the flight-tracking site FlightAware, more than a quarter of those in Chicago. Dozens had been canceled in New York, Philadelphia and Boston.\nMany people complained that their flights had been canceled far in advance, only to see snowless skies at the time they were supposed to take off.\nAirlines err on the side of caution when it comes to flight schedules to avoid causing more chaos in their systems, said George Hamlin, an airline and commercial aerospace consultant. That airlines have few empty seats on a lot of flights means rebooking travelers can be more difficult if they are forced to make a late cancellation, he said.\n\u201cThe problem is once you get a major airline system out of kilter, it is a huge problem to get it back working again,\u201d Mr. Hamlin said. \u201cSo the airlines have adopted a policy of doing this on a preventative basis.\u201d\nBut some travelers were able to find a silver lining amid the chaos.\nAs Dr. Jennifer Hartwell was in midflight from Austin, Tex., to Detroit on Friday evening, she saw that her connecting flight to Indianapolis had been delayed to the next morning. She sent a text message to her husband from the plane, asking him to book a rental car, and then asked a flight attendant to see if there were other passengers who wanted to take the four-hour road trip with her.\nThree other passengers took her up. One of them had been racing to get home because of a death in the family and would have missed a memorial service if she had waited for the delayed flight, said Dr. Hartwell, a trauma surgeon.\nWhen they arrived in Indianapolis in the wee hours of Saturday morning, the father of the woman going to the memorial service embraced Dr. Hartwell.\n\u201cThank you very much for getting my daughter to me,\u201d he said through tears.", "html": "<html>\n <body>\n  <div class=\"css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn\">\n   <div class=\"css-4w7y5l\">\n    <p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">\n     CHICAGO \u2014 Heavy snowfall, high winds and a dangerous mix of rain and sleet were expected to hit swaths of the Northeast on Sunday, prompting officials to warn of icy roadways and power outages from a vast winter storm that had been pummeling the Great Plains and the Great Lakes.\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">\n     The storm, which complicated travel on Saturday and busted plans for the three-day weekend across much of the country, had already caused problems from Kansas, where the governor declared an emergency, to Chicago, where a United Airlines plane slid off a concrete surface.\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">\n     Flights have been canceled by the thousands, and rapidly dropping temperatures on Sunday in parts of the Northeast would freeze anything wet, creating \u201cextremely dangerous\u201d conditions on the roadways.\n    </p>\n   </div>\n   <aside class=\"css-1m2ozyi\">\n    <span>\n    </span>\n   </aside>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"css-1xzfkia\">\n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-cards=\"\">\n    <p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">\n     A view in Lake County, IL courtesy of\n     <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LCPASSAGE?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">\n      @LCPASSAGE\n     </a>\n     .

In a letter to parents, the trip was described as an opportunity for students to live out their faith and demonstrate in support of all life \u201cborn and unborn.\u201d\nIn a statement, the Diocese of Covington and Covington Catholic High School condemned the behavior by the students and extended their \u201cdeepest apologies\u201d to the elder, as well as to Native Americans in general.\n\u201cThis behavior is opposed to the Church\u2019s teachings on the dignity and respect of the human person,\u201d the statement said.\nThe school\u2019s website and Facebook page were down as of Saturday afternoon.\nThe encounter became the latest touchpoint for racial tensions in America, particularly under Mr. Trump, who has painted immigrants in broad strokes as rapists and drug dealers and recently mocked Senator Elizabeth Warren with a reference to Wounded Knee and Little Bighorn, sacred ground for Native Americans whose ancestors fought and died there.\nAcross the country, Mr. Trump\u2019s name \u2014 and his campaign for a wall on the southern border with Mexico \u2014 have been used to goad minorities, including by high school students at sporting events.\n[Read more about the Wounded Knee massacre, the Battle of Little Bighorn and why the president invoked them to attack Senator Elizabeth Warren, a 2020 presidential candidate.]\nThe episode drew widespread condemnation from Native Americans, Catholics and politicians alike.\n\u201cThis veteran put his life on the line for our country,\u201d Representative Deb Haaland, a Democrat of New Mexico who recently became one of the first Native American women to serve in Congress, said on Twitter. \u201cThe students\u2019 display of blatant hate, disrespect, and intolerance is a signal of how common decency has decayed under this administration. Heartbreaking.\u201d\nSisters of Mercy, a group of Roman Catholic women who take vows of poverty, chastity, obedience and service, condemned the behavior in the videos as disturbing and bigoted. \u201cRacism and intolerance in all forms go directly against Catholic social teaching,\u201d the Sisters of Mercy said.\nIn a statement on Saturday, the Indigenous Peoples Movement identified the man in the videos as Nathan Phillips, an Omaha elder, a veteran of the Vietnam War and the former director of the Native Youth Alliance, a group that works to ensure that traditional culture and spiritual ways are upheld for future generations. Mr. Phillips also holds an annual ceremony honoring Native American veterans in Arlington National Cemetery, the group said.\nMr. Phillips could not be reached for comment on Saturday. He told The Washington Post that he noticed the teenagers taunting participants at the Indigenous Peoples March.\n\u201cIt was getting ugly, and I was thinking: \u2018I\u2019ve got to find myself an exit out of this situation and finish my song at the Lincoln Memorial,\u2019\u201d Mr. Phillips told The Post. \u201cI started going that way, and that guy in the hat stood in my way and we were at an impasse. He just blocked my way and wouldn\u2019t allow me to retreat.\u201d\nIn a video by Kaya Taitano, posted to Instagram, Mr. Phillips stood outside the Lincoln Memorial and wiped his eyes. \u201cI heard them saying \u2018Build that wall! Build that wall!\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cThis is indigenous land.

Mr. Steincross started at Fox2 as a general assignment reporter in 1996 and became a morning newscaster in 1998, according to the station\u2019s website.\n\u201cThe Fox2 management team spoke to Kevin following the mistake, and we believe that it was truly inadvertent and does not reflect Kevin\u2019s core beliefs,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cKevin is extremely upset by the mistake and regrets it deeply.

Others on Twitter questioned how he could mix up the insult with Dr. King\u2019s name.\nDuring his lifetime, Dr. King\u2019s last name was often swapped out for the epithet, both by avowed racists and others who claimed to have used it mistakenly. More recently, American broadcast journalists have made similar utterances in 2005, 2010, and 2014, the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle reported.\nHeather Taylor, a sergeant in the St. Louis police force and president of the Ethical Society of Police, an association for African-American police officers in St. Louis, said the slur was so insulting because of the long history of its use against a man of towering stature.\n\u201cDr. King was murdered,\u201d she said in a phone interview. \u201cHe was assassinated fighting for equality. It\u2019s a joke in some communities with that term, and it\u2019s just not acceptable.\u201d\nSergeant Taylor said that using the slur in place of Dr. King\u2019s name was \u201cnot something that is normally a slip of the tongue.\u201d She believes that Mr. Steincross should be fired.\nThe incident attracted attention from people across the country on social media. Nadine Graham, a New York-based music writer, called it strange and disheartening.\n\u201cYou can\u2019t control what somebody has going on in their mind or maybe their everyday lingo,\" she said in a phone interview. \u201cBut on TV, you should be a little more careful.\u201d\nEarlier this month, Jeremy Kappell, then a meteorologist for WHEC Channel 10 in Rochester, N.Y., was fired after uttering the slur while describing a city park named for Dr. King. During an evening broadcast, Mr. Kappell said the slur and then corrected himself, repeating Dr. King\u2019s last name accurately.\nA WHEC employee saw a post about the slur on social media and alerted the station. As the clip shot around online, the mayor and City Council called for \u201creal consequences for the news personality involved and also for the management team that failed to immediately apologize.\u201d\nThe station\u2019s vice president and general manager, Richard A. Reingold, announced that Mr. Kappell had been fired after a two-day internal investigation.\n\u201cThese words have no place on News10NBC\u2019s air, and the fact that we broadcast them disheartens and disgusts me; that it was not caught immediately is inexcusable,\u201d Mr. Reingold said in a statement. \u201cI regret that we did not immediately interrupt our broadcast and apologize on the spot.\u201d\nMr. Kappell released a video after his firing, saying he had jumbled his words and apologizing to anyone who felt hurt. He also discussed the matter in an interview with CNN\u2019s Don Lemon, who told him, \u201cI don\u2019t understand why you were fired.\u201d\nBernice King, the civil rights leader\u2019s daughter, weighed in on the firing during an interview with TMZ. She said Mr. Kappell should have been reassigned or sent to bias training but not fired.\nSergeant Taylor said she hoped the uproar would become \u201ca teachable moment\u201d for people to understand what Dr. King sacrificed.\n\u201cHe deserves all the dignity that comes with his name,\u201d she said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t deserve that term.\u201d", "html": "<html>\n <body>\n  <div class=\"css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn\">\n   <div class=\"css-4w7y5l\">\n    <p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">\n     A television news anchor in St. Louis apologized after he uttered a racial slur in place of the Rev.

That is one little thing that no one would ever connect.\u201d\nMr. Allaire experiences the service-driven life of yoga through his work for the Veterans Yoga Project, which provides yoga to roughly 1,000 veterans and their families per week as well as trains prospective teachers. \u201cWe will have four or five people in a conference room at a V.A.,\u201d he said. \u201cThere might be an Iraq war vet in his 20s, a Korean War vet in his 80s, some can barely move, some may be missing limbs and the teacher\u2019s job is to create space for a person to do a twist.

If I was to describe the average veteran, they are so stuck in their body that they are not really breathing. We teach them to breathe more deeply in their body.\u201d\nImage\nCredit\nCole Wilson for The New York Times\nMr. Riley notes that teaching veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder requires precautions. \u201cFor instance, I teach with my back to the door,\u201d he said. \u201cBy allowing veterans to see the door, it gives them a little more ease in their body.\u201d\nHe added: \u201cAs I move, I try not to move too much. I don\u2019t do a lot of hands-on adjustments. There is a space with vets that I don\u2019t violate. I don\u2019t get too close sometimes, I allow them to feel what is coming up and sometimes it doesn\u2019t feel good and that\u2019s O.K. It is difficult, but you have to sit with it if you really want to heal.

I know it works. Since 2012 when I went to the V.A. and started practicing yoga, my relationship with my children has improved tremendously.

When I teach the military, I teach a pretty power-focused class. I tend to hold poses longer and talk more specifically. They tend to like the direction \u2014 there is a sense of safety in the authority that they are used to. But I introduce a playfulness; I curse. I keep it real.\u201d\nImage\nCredit\nGabriella Demczuk for The New York Times\nSometimes people are skeptical at first, especially about yoga\u2019s ability to offer the intensity that military workouts entail. \u201cYou invite some humor in and give them something to find their edge with,\u201d Ms. Corwin said. \u201cWithin that community, I can use that different voice. With a bunch of PTSD vets, you wouldn\u2019t take them to those places.

It\u2019s the opposite of what you should be doing. I try to really focus on the breathing what would happen if you just let gravity take over,\u201d he explained\n\u201cMy passion is getting men into yoga and trying to get them connected to themselves, the pain they are feeling and the things they need to let go. It is incredible to see people learn that it is not about getting into the pose,\u201d Mr. Johnson said. \u201cSoldiers are very good at being in the moment, much better than I have seen with a lot of civilian yogis. But what I am learning is that it doesn\u2019t matter if you are a former military vet who served four terms in Iraq or a housewife with four kids and anxiety issues. We approach those issues the same way. You think you have all this control in yoga, but it\u2019s not about the control, it\u2019s about kind of letting go.\u201d\nImage\nCredit\nIlana Panich-Linsman for The New York Times\nImage\nCredit\nIlana Panich-Linsman for The New York Times\nImage\nCredit\nIlana Panich-Linsman for The New York Times\nThe studio attracts veterans, and sometimes it holds special classes, \u201cWarriors in Poses,\u201d focused on them. \u201cIt is a class for veterans taught by a veteran but opened to the entire community,\u201d Mr. Johnson said. \u201cI have been told that it is interesting to see a veteran teaching and I think they do appreciate it.

It\u2019s definitely not the turnout I was looking for,\u201d said Peggy Baron, 53, a lawyer from Dublin, Ohio, who said that the first Washington march two years ago had been \u201cwall-to-wall women.\u201d\nImage\nPeople gathered at Freedom Plaza in Washington on Saturday for the Women\u2019s March.\nCredit\nSarah Silbiger/The New York Times\nBut as the morning progressed, throngs of marchers began to fill the plaza, and spirits visibly lifted.\n\u201cI came two years ago. It\u2019s definitely smaller, but the spirit is very much alive,\u201d said Rachel Stucky, 53, an educator from Salem, Ore. She added: \u201cThe experience I had two years ago was indescribable. I wanted to feel that way again.\u201d\nThe events around the country were partly a celebration of what has been achieved since the first march. An unprecedented number of women have been elected to Congress, many with the help of women who became politically active for the first time after marching in 2017.\nImage\nMarchers gathered near Columbus Circle in New York.\nCredit\nGabriella Angotti-Jones for The New York Times\nBut the gatherings were also a test of how the movement has weathered the storm of controversy in recent months. The New York-based leaders of the national Women\u2019s March group that planned the first march on Washington have been under fire for allegations of anti-Semitism.\n[Listen to the episode of The Daily on divisions in the Women\u2019s March.]\nTamika Mallory, co-president of Women\u2019s March, has publicly praised Louis Farrakhan, leader of the Nation of Islam, who is widely reviled for anti-Semitic speeches. The Women\u2019s March has issued a series of statements denouncing anti-Semitism and apologized for its delayed response to the controversy, but Ms. Mallory has declined to denounce Mr. Farrakhan himself.\nSome marchers said they were conflicted about whether to come, given the controversy over the anti-Semitism charges. In Washington, Trish Klein, Jody Kanikula and Amy Hain from Chicago said they had an intense discussion before deciding to make the trip.\nImage\nImages from the Women\u2019s March, clockwise from top left: Washington; Washington; New York; Atlanta.\nCredit\nClockwise from top left: Sarah Silbiger/The New York Times (2); Adrienne Grunwald for The New York Times; Audra Melton for The New York Times\nIn the end, they chose to do it, because \u201capathy is not an option,\u201d said Ms. Klein, a 39-year-old special education teacher.\nThe controversy over Mr. Farrakhan added to tensions that were already brewing between the national Women\u2019s March group and some of the local activists around the country who planned marches in their own hometowns.\n[Read our report on women\u2019s marches around the world.]\nOn Saturday, those divisions manifested themselves in two rival marches in New York and two in Philadelphia.\nImage\nLinda Sarsour, left, and Tamika Mallory, two of the organizers of the Women\u2019s March, walked together on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington on Saturday.\nCredit\nJoshua Roberts/Reuters\nIn New York, some marchers said they had done research to decide which event to attend, but many said they merely went to whichever was more conveniently located. The march held by the Women\u2019s March Alliance on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, which advertised its opposition to anti-Semitisim, attracted a crowd that stretched about 10 city blocks, although there was ample space between the marchers.\nAbout four miles south, in Foley Square, a rally planned by a group affiliated with the national Women\u2019s March attracted a modest crowd.\n\u201cI was worried that it was going to be small and it turns out it\u2019s small,\u201d said Donna McDonough, a 69-year-old registered nurse who traveled by train from Hamden, Conn. Noting the controversy, she said: \u201cI think Mallory should unequivocally boycott Farrakhan but no one should boycott this march. She doesn\u2019t represent the entire organization.\u201d\nImage\nDemonstrators in the Women\u2019s March in Los Angeles on Saturday walked toward City Hall.\nCredit\nJessica Pons for The New York Times\nIn Philadelphia, where the two rival events were separated by only a few hundred yards, many marchers weren\u2019t even aware of the difference between the events or didn\u2019t care.\nThe marches did not attract many high-profile national figures, although Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, who recently announced she was running for president in 2020, appeared at an event in Iowa. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez spoke at the Women\u2019s March Alliance rally, and Representative Ayanna Pressley spoke in Boston.\nIt is difficult to say how much the controversy depressed turnout.\nEven before the controversy, organizers of the Washington march debated the idea of trying to hold another big national demonstration, knowing it would be impossible to come close to the turnout of the first year, when more than half a million people gathered on the streets of the capital.\nImage\nRepresentative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, left of center, joined the throng of marchers in New York on Saturday.\nCredit\nEarl Wilson/The New York Times\nJo Reger, professor of sociology at Oakland University in Michigan, who studies feminist movements, said other factors that can depress turnout include activist burnout, and paradoxically, success.\n\u201cMarches or movements can lose some momentum when people see some of their issues being addressed,\u201d she said. \u201cWith the recent midterm elections, some may feel like the country is going in a different direction after the Trump election and that may lower the numbers participating.\u201d\nSome who marched in previous years said the controversy was just one more reason to stay home.\nSavannah Fritz, a 24-year-old supervisor at a homeless shelter who marched in Boston in 2017 and Philadelphia last year decided to sit out this year because she felt that the money spent on stages and portable toilets could be put to better use.\nImage\nParticipants at an event organized by state groups marched in the rain in Atlanta on Saturday.\nCredit\nAudra Melton for The New York Times\n\u201cI obviously know that protests are an important part of social justice, but I just feel like the money would be way better spent actually combating the issues the Trump administration has created,\u201d she said. The anti-Semitism charges, she said, also created a \u201cmajor hesitation.\u201d\nStill, there was evidence on Saturday that the political events of the last two years had inspired a new level activism among many women.\nLori Clarke, 62, a retired schoolteacher from Bucks County, Pa., said the 2018 women\u2019s march in Philadelphia was the first time she had attended a public protest.\n\u201cI\u2019m just a normal everyday average woman,\u201d Ms. Clark said. \u201cI would never have thought of coming out to protest.\u201d\n\u201cI hate crowds,\u201d she added. \u201cThe reality of a Trump administration hit home, and I felt that I needed my voice to be heard.\u201d\nAnd in Washington, Hilary Ruesch, a 38-year-old marketing director for a wine importer, said she and others had traveled from Brooklyn to \u201ccome back to where it all began.\u201d\nThey were members of a local chapter for the liberal grass-roots group Indivisible. The chapter has a mailing list of about 300 members, but in two years, the core of the group \u2014 the ones who could be counted on to do the grunt work of local political advocacy \u2014 had dwindled to about 50 people. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen some attrition,\u201d she said.

An applicant\u2019s race does not provide an automatic boost or guarantee admission, the university said. Rather, \u201cThis factor, like all others, is always considered in the context of everything else known about a candidate and in light of the range of contributions the candidate might make to the University.\u201d\nThe case has many similarities to a deeply divisive lawsuit that Students for Fair Admissions brought against Harvard, leading to a hard-fought trial last fall and a national conversation over the role of race in college admissions.\nBut unlike the Harvard case, which focused on whether the university was particularly unfair to one minority group, Asian-Americans, the U.N.C. case is more akin to high-profile affirmative action suits of the past, which accused schools of favoring black and Hispanic students over others.\nThe cases are also somewhat different in legal approaches. The plaintiffs accuse Harvard of violating federal civil rights law, and U.N.C. of violating civil rights law and the Constitution\u2019s Equal Protection Clause. Both lawsuits were tailored to reach the Supreme Court, and they amount to a two-pronged attack that maximizes the chances for a hearing.\nOriginally filed in 2014, both suits were engineered by Edward Blum, a conservative activist who opposes racial preferences. At this point it is a tossup which of the cases will reach the high court first. It is possible that if one gets there first, the Supreme Court could decide to call up the other as well, lawyers said.\nBoth sides in the U.N.C. suit asked a federal court judge to rule immediately in their favor, rather than allowing the case to go to trial.\nImage\nThe briefs were filed a few days after the chancellor ordered the removal of the remnants of a Confederate monument on campus.\nCredit\nJulia Wall/The News & Observer, via Associated Press\nThe filings cap a stressful week for U.N.C., whose chancellor, Carol Folt, ordered the removal of the last remnants of a Confederate monument on campus that had become a focus of racial tension, and then announced her resignation.\nIn an email to the U.N.C. community on Friday, Ms. Folt portrayed the suit as part of a coordinated campaign against race-conscious admissions policies at three leading universities, U.N.C., Harvard and the University of Texas. (Students for Fair Admissions filed a similar admissions suit against the University of Texas in state court in 2017.)\nShe sought to reassure students that no one on campus was underqualified. \u201cWe are proud of the contributions our students make in our community, and we want each of you to know that you rightfully earned your place here,\u201d she said.\nLike the Harvard suit, the U.N.C. case rests heavily on dueling statistical analyses, one for Students for Fair Admissions by Peter Arcidiacono, a Duke economist who is also the plaintiffs\u2019 expert in the Harvard case, and one for U.N.C. by Caroline Hoxby, a well-known economist and educational theorist at Stanford University.\nProfessor Arcidiacono found that racial preferences accounted for nearly a quarter of admissions for in-state Hispanic applicants and nearly 42 percent of admissions for in-state African-American applicants. Professor Hoxby, however, found that race affected just a tiny share \u2014 0.8 to 5.6 percent \u2014 of admissions decisions.\nU.N.C., a public flagship university, admits about 9,500 for a class of 4,000, of which 82 percent must be North Carolinians.\nThe plaintiffs argue that U.N.C. could achieve the racial and ethnic diversity it wants by focusing more heavily on socioeconomic and geographic factors in admissions. U.N.C. argued, echoing Harvard in its case, that such an approach would reduce both the diversity and educational excellence of the class. The U.N.C. brief said black and Hispanic students already feel marginalized, and that the approach proposed by the plaintiffs would leave them even more so.\n\u201cUniversity professors observe a lack of minorities in certain classes, fields or areas of campus,\u201d the U.N.C. brief says. \u201cIn turn, underrepresented minority students report feelings of isolation and unfair pressure to represent their race or ethnicity \u2014 effects that further impede education.\u201d\nIn the Harvard case, the plaintiffs are arguing that Harvard suppresses the number of Asian-American students admitted by holding them to a higher standard on grades and test scores, and by reaching for racial stereotypes to downgrade their applications. Harvard has said that it does not discriminate, and that the case is built on a flawed and hypothetical statistical model that does not reflect reality.\nThe judge in the Harvard case has asked for new closing arguments in February, and lawyers say that she may not rule until June.", "html": "<html>\n <body>\n  <div class=\"css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn\">\n   <div class=\"css-4w7y5l\">\n    <p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">\n     The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill weighs race so heavily in its admissions process that it is the predominant factor in determining whether many black and Hispanic students get in, according to court papers filed on Friday by an anti-affirmative action group that is also\n     <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/15/us/harvard-affirmative-action-asian-americans.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">\n      suing Harvard\n     </a>\n     .\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">\n     The group, Students for Fair Admissions, says the university is excluding white and Asian applicants in favor of less qualified black and Hispanic students.\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">\n     The plaintiffs accuse U.N.C., a public flagship university, of using race \u201cat every stage\u201d of the admissions process, in violation of the law, \u201ceven when the application gives no indication that race affected the student\u2019s life in any way.\u201d\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">\n     \u201cThis is wrong,\u201d the university said in a brief in its defense, also filed Friday.

(Students for Fair Admissions filed a similar admissions suit against the University of Texas in state court in 2017.)\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">\n     She sought to reassure students that no one on campus was underqualified. \u201cWe are proud of the contributions our students make in our community, and we want each of you to know that you rightfully earned your place here,\u201d she said.\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">\n     Like the Harvard suit, the U.N.C. case rests heavily on dueling statistical analyses, one for Students for Fair Admissions by Peter Arcidiacono, a Duke economist who is also the plaintiffs\u2019 expert in the Harvard case, and one for U.N.C. by Caroline Hoxby, a well-known economist and educational theorist at Stanford University.\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">\n     Professor Arcidiacono found that racial preferences accounted for nearly a quarter of admissions for in-state Hispanic applicants and nearly 42 percent of admissions for in-state African-American applicants. Professor Hoxby, however, found that race affected just a tiny share \u2014 0.8 to 5.6 percent \u2014 of admissions decisions.\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">\n     U.N.C., a public flagship university, admits about 9,500 for a class of 4,000, of which 82 percent must be North Carolinians.\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">\n     The plaintiffs argue that U.N.C. could achieve the racial and ethnic diversity it wants by focusing more heavily on socioeconomic and geographic factors in admissions. U.N.C. argued, echoing Harvard in its case, that such an approach would reduce both the diversity and educational excellence of the class. The U.N.C. brief said black and Hispanic students already feel marginalized, and that the approach proposed by the plaintiffs would leave them even more so.\n    </p>\n   </div>\n   <aside class=\"css-1m2ozyi\">\n    <span>\n    </span>\n   </aside>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn\">\n   <div class=\"css-4w7y5l\">\n    <p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">\n     \u201cUniversity professors observe a lack of minorities in certain classes, fields or areas of campus,\u201d the U.N.C. brief says. \u201cIn turn, underrepresented minority students report feelings of isolation and unfair pressure to represent their race or ethnicity \u2014 effects that further impede education.\u201d\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">\n     In the Harvard case, the plaintiffs are arguing that Harvard suppresses the number of Asian-American students admitted by holding them to a higher standard on grades and test scores, and by reaching for\n     <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/15/us/harvard-asian-enrollment-applicants.html?module=inline\" title=\"\">\n      racial stereotypes to downgrade their applications\n     </a>\n     .

(1988)\nIn the words of our reviewer, this Pulitzer Prize-winning work (the first of Branch\u2019s three-volume social history) tells \u201cthe story behind the uprooting of America\u2019s tragic racial traditions without which a definitive interpretation of post-World War II America cannot be made.\u201d King is at the center of the book, but its scope is more broad, and Branch\u2019s \u201cfundamental insight is that King shared the movement with an extraordinary array of catalytic personalities,\u201d including Ella Baker, Bayard Rustin and numerous student activists, whom our reviewer said helped marry King\u2019s \u201cintellectual grasp of theology to the direct action that made the movement successful.\u201d\nImage\nBEARING THE CROSS\nMartin Luther King, Jr., and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference\nBy David J. Garrow\n800 pages. William Morrow. (1986)\nRelying on interviews with King\u2019s closest associates, F.B.I. documents (including wiretapped conversations) and King\u2019s personal papers, this biography, which also won a Pulitzer, explores \u201cthe sacred and profane\u201d aspects of King\u2019s life, documenting his civil rights achievements along with \u201cthe inner torments King suffered because of his compulsive sexual adventuring and because of the Federal Bureau of Investigation\u2019s conscienceless campaign to use this weakness to destroy him,\u201d according to our reviewer. Garrow shows how King\u2019s intellect and analytical side powered his work, while his faith sustained him.\nImage\nMARCH TRILOGY\nBy John Lewis, Andrew Aydin and Nate Powell\n560 pp. Top Shelf Productions. (2016)\nThis graphic memoir series, the third of which won a National Book Award, chronicles Lewis\u2019s coming-of-age in the civil rights movement as a student activist working with King and others. Our reviewer called it \u201ca capsule lesson in courage of conscience, a story that inspires without moralizing or simplifying in hindsight.\u201d It opens with the march in Selma, Ala., that Lewis led in March 1965 \u2014 a turning point for the civil rights movement that is known as \u201cBloody Sunday\u201d for the violent beatings state troopers and local police officers inflicted on nonviolent protesters, including Lewis, who was 25 at the time. Our reviewer said the book is \u201cdesigned to help new generations of readers visualize the possibilities of political engagement\u201d and \u201cis the story of an education, an introduction to the difficult art of principled dissent \u2014 or, as Lewis has called it, \u2018necessary trouble.\u2019\u201d\nImage\nWHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE: CHAOS OR COMMUNITY?\nBy Martin Luther King Jr.\n256 pp. Beacon Press. (1967)\nIn his final book, written in 1967 after a decade of civil rights work, King lays out his vision for America\u2019s future, including the need for better jobs and housing, higher pay and quality education. He also writes about how reforms had fallen short: \u201cLaws are passed in a crisis mood after a Birmingham or a Selma, but no substantial fervor survives the formal signing of legislation. The recording of the law in itself is treated as the reality of the reform.\u201d\nImage\nDREAMER\nBy Charles Johnson\n236 pp. Scribner. (1998)\nIn this imagined account of King\u2019s final days, Johnson gives him a doppelg\u00e4nger named Chaym Smith who, when the pair meet in Chicago, gets a job as King\u2019s stand-in. Smith served in the military during the Korean War and, since his return, has suffered alcoholism and had a mental breakdown; he lost his wife and kids. As Smith learns to impersonate King, Johnson uses the parallel to explore how society determines what makes one man great and another not. \u201cJohnson has created King\u2019s body double and spiritual doppelg\u00e4nger not so he can unfold a thriller but in order to explore the soul of inequality and some of the unpleasant ways in which the world divides,\u201d wrote our reviewer. \u201cAs a journey, \u2018Dreamer\u2019 is not content merely to explore inequality and its pesky moral dilemmas; it goes farther, to hold up a mirror in which the interrelatedness of these apparent opposites can be viewed.\u201d\nImage\nDEAR MARTIN\nBy Nic Stone\n210 pp. Crown Books for Young Readers. (2016)\n(Ages 14 and up)\nThis young adult novel follows Justyce McAllister, an ambitious black student at an elite private school in Atlanta who is the captain of the debate team and has stellar grades. But a number of racially motivated incidents force Justyce to realize some will always judge him by his skin color. In his diary, which is addressed to King, he writes, \u201cI grew up in a rough area, but I know I\u2019m a good dude, Martin. I thought if I made sure to be an upstanding member of society, I\u2019d be exempt from the stuff THOSE black guys deal with, you know? Really hard to swallow that I was wrong.\u201d\nImage\nI MAY NOT GET THERE WITH YOU\nThe True Martin Luther King Jr.\nBy Michael Eric Dyson\n404 pp. The Free Press. (2000)\nIn this more recent biography of King, Dyson argues that we have \u201csanitized his ideas\u201d and \u201ctwisted his identity so he appears more saintly,\u201d wrote our reviewer. King lost many white supporters when, in the last few years of his life, his eyes were opened to America\u2019s commitment to racism, and his rhetoric became less hopeful. In 1968, he declared, \u201cI am sorry to have to say that the vast majority of white Americans are racists, either consciously or unconsciously,\u201d while advocating for wide-ranging affirmative action programs and black nationalist and socialist ideas. According to our reviewer, Dyson is at his best when he \u201cprovides close readings of the less well-known sermons.\u201d Dyson suggests a moratorium on reading King\u2019s \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech, writing, \u201cIf we are forced to live without that speech for a decade, we may be forced to live it instead. In so doing, we can truly preserve King\u2019s hope for racial revolution.\u201d", "html": "<html>\n <body>\n  <div class=\"css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn\">\n   <div class=\"css-4w7y5l\">\n    <p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">\n     As is often the case with those who die young, Martin Luther King Jr. has become more symbol than man: pacifist, beacon of nonviolent racial reform.

It will be the only total lunar eclipse of the year, and that in itself should be reason enough to stay up late and marvel as the moon gets swallowed by Earth\u2019s shadow.\nYou might have heard that this eclipse is also being called a \u201cSuper Blood Wolf Moon.\u201d But as astronomers know, no number of edgy modifiers could make this display of cosmic clockwork any cooler.\n[Sign up to get reminders for space and astronomy events on your calendar.]\nUnlike a total solar eclipse, when the moon moseys between the sun and the Earth, it\u2019s our planet that slides between the sun and the moon during a total lunar eclipse. As the Earth blocks the sun, only slivers of light make it through the planet\u2019s atmosphere and to the moon.\n\u201cIf you were standing on the surface of the moon when this event was happening, and you were staring back at the Earth, what you would see is this beautiful reddish-orangish tinted ring,\u201d said Jackie Faherty, an astrophysicist at the American Museum of Natural History.\nThat ring of light is made up of every sunrise and sunset happening on Earth at that moment in time. It\u2019s the same light that makes the moon look red to those of us on Earth during the eclipse.\nWho can see the lunar eclipse?\nThis eclipse will be visible in the night sky across North and South America. Skywatchers in parts of Europe and Africa will see part of or the entire eclipse in their predawn skies.\nPeople living in Asia and Australia will not see this eclipse, unfortunately.\nWhen can I see the eclipse?\nThe opening act starts Sunday night at 9:36 p.m. Eastern Time as the moon first enters Earth\u2019s outer shadow, also called the penumbra. Darkness will creep up the lower left portion of the moon, almost imperceptibly.\nAt about 10:34 p.m., the moon will start to enter Earth\u2019s inner shadow, or the umbra. This marks the beginning of the partial lunar eclipse, when it will appear as if something took a bite out of the moon.\nAt 11:41 p.m., the moon will enter totality and turn completely red as it is devoured by Earth\u2019s umbral shadow. It will stay this way for about one hour, and at 12:12 a.m. on Monday, it will reach the darkest part of Earth\u2019s shadow, appearing to be at its most coppery red.\n\u201cThe moon becomes 10,000 times dimmer than what it was,\u201d said Brian Murphy, director of the Holcomb Observatory and Planetarium at Butler University in Indianapolis. \u201cBecause it is so dim at that point, you\u2019ll be able to see stars right around the moon.\u201d That\u2019s interesting, he said, because full moons tend to be so bright that they outshine stars in their celestial neighborhood.\nAs it begins to exit the umbral shadow at 12:44 a.m., the moon will start to brighten. By 2:48 a.m., the moon will return to its usual brightness, and the eclipse will be completely over.\nPeople on the West Coast have a better time slot to watch the show because totality will occur between 8:41 p.m. and 9:44 p.m. Pacific Time.\nSync your calendar with the solar system\nNever miss an eclipse, a meteor shower, a rocket launch or any other astronomical and space event that's out of this world.\nDec. 31, 2018\nWhere should I go to watch and what will I need?\nThat\u2019s the best thing about this celestial show: As long as you\u2019re located on the half of the planet that will experience the eclipse, you can watch it from nearly anywhere, weather permitting.\nDark skies are always a plus, but your backyard or city street will work just fine. No need for fancy equipment, as your two eyes are all you need.\nBut if you want to enhance your experience, binoculars will let you better see the whole picture as the moon\u2019s surface changes color.\nWhat if it\u2019s too cold to go outside or too cloudy to see?\nYou can watch the lunar eclipse online. The Slooh Community Observatory, a telescope broadcast service, will live-stream the event from the Canary Islands and Chile starting around 10:30 p.m. Eastern Time on Sunday. Timeanddate.com will also host a broadcast.\nWhy is it being called a \u2018Super Blood Wolf Moon\u2019?\nThis lunar eclipse has been given a name that sounds like it belongs to a heavy metal band. But it\u2019s really all glitter, not gold. So let\u2019s break it down:\nSuper\nThe term \u201csupermoon\u201d has come to loosely mean a full moon near perigee, or the point when it is closest to Earth in its elliptical orbit. Normally when this happens, most people can\u2019t tell, as the moon appears only slightly bigger than it does any other night.\nBut when compared with the moon at apogee, when it is farthest away from the Earth, the differences come into focus. For example, on Monday during perigee, the moon will be approximately 222,040 miles away from our planet, in contrast to Jan. 9, when it was at apogee and about 252,350 miles away. A \u201csupermoon\u201d is about 14 percent larger than one at apogee and 30 percent brighter.\nBut this term was actually first coined in 1979 by an astrologist named Richard Nolle, not by an astronomer.\nBlood\nThis is an embellishment of the coppery-red tint that the moon takes on during any lunar eclipse. Sometimes it\u2019s more brown.\nWolf\nNothing to do with werewolves.\nThe \u201cwolf\u201d title has been attributed to the Native Americans\u2019 name for January\u2019s full moon. According to The Old Farmer\u2019s Almanac, the term comes from the \u201cAlgonquin tribes who lived in regions from New England to Lake Superior.\u201d But this sourcing is suspect.\n\u201cThe \u2018wolf\u2019 part, it\u2019s almost like this stereotypical, romanticized version of the native culture,\u201d said Annette Lee, a mixed-race Dakota-Sioux astronomer at St. Cloud State University in Minnesota.\nThe term, she said, is an oversimplification that sort of groups hundreds of distinct Native American tribes together into one blob. For example, the Ojibwe tribe \u2014 which historically lived around Lake Superior and is a part of the Algonquin-language family \u2014 called both the month of January and its full moon the \u201cGreat Spirit Moon,\u201d she said. In their language, it is \u201cGichi-manidoo-giizis,\u201d according to Ojibwe.net.\n\u201cI think the problem with \u2018The Wolf Moon\u2019 is that it takes something that is really important and really meaningful out of its cultural context,\u201d she said. As a result, \u201cit doesn\u2019t have the substance that it needs for people to really learn about the culture in a dignified way.\u201d\nWhat else is happening in the sky this year?\nThere are two more \u201csupermoons\u201d on Feb. 19 and March 21 this year, though neither will be a \u201cblood moon.\u201d\nThere will also be two solar eclipses \u2014 a total solar eclipse visible in parts of South America in July and a year-ending annular, or \u201cring of fire,\u201d eclipse on Dec. 26, which will be visible over the Arabian Peninsula and India.\nNov. 11 also marks a Mercury transit, which is when people at points on the East Coast can watch the solar system\u2019s innermost planet make a six-hour long trek across the sun.\nRecent news about the moon\nWhat Happened to Earth\u2019s Ancient Craters?

But as she made her way across snowy Iowa during her first visit as a presidential candidate, Ms. Gillibrand put far more emphasis on her upstate New York roots, bipartisanship and small-town political ancestry.\nShe talked about her love of RVs and her family vacation last summer to see a Nascar race \u2014 and suggested she could make an RV trip in Iowa this year. She spoke of her faith and finding common ground with Republicans. And she harked back repeatedly to her first run for Congress, in 2006, when she ousted a Republican incumbent in a seat that her pollster warned she couldn\u2019t win because there were \u201cmore cows than Democrats.\u201d\n\u201cI grew up in upstate New York, a community not unlike this one,\u201d Ms. Gillibrand said as she introduced herself at a house party in Sioux City on Friday evening. Of her first race, she said, \u201cIt was a two-to-one Republican district, a lot like the district we\u2019re in today.\u201d\nThe next morning, inside a cafe in Boone, she told the dozen or so people there: \u201cI really appreciate being in a rural place. I\u2019m from a rural place. I grew up in a rural place. I represented a rural place for Congress.\u201d\nAt a political moment when many Democratic voters are desperate to find a winner who can beat President Trump, Ms. Gillibrand\u2019s emphasis on her past representing a conservative House seat seemed an effort to ensure she is not pigeonholed as just another blue-state Democrat, or someone who does not understand rural America.\nTo that end, Ms. Gillibrand has placed her campaign headquarters in Troy, N.Y., near where she grew up and in her old House district but relatively far from a major urban center (though a short drive to New Hampshire). She made her first campaign appearance at a diner there, too.\n\u201cThe thing she really reiterates is she isn\u2019t from New York. She\u2019s from upstate,\u201d said J.D. Scholten, a Democrat who lost his 2018 House race to Representative Steve King, the Iowa Republican who has come under fire for his remarks on white supremacy and white nationalism.\nMr. Scholten, who attended two of Ms. Gillibrand\u2019s events, said the problem with the current Democratic Party is that it\u2019s \u201cmore and more a Whole Foods party and we\u2019re in a Dollar General district.\u201d\n\u201cShe\u2019s able to have that experience,\u201d Mr. Scholten said of Ms. Gillibrand, \u201cand that\u2019s important for Democrats.\u201d\nThe challenge for Ms. Gillibrand is that the candidate she was, ideologically, in 2006 to win that upstate district is no longer the candidate she is now. In the House, she had an A-rating from the National Rifle Association; now she has an F. Her stances on immigration have flipped, as well. She has said she is now embarrassed by her old positions.\nMs. Gillibrand, who appears especially comfortable meeting voters in small and more intimate settings, was generally well-received on her first Iowa trip, which included a mix of coffee-shop stops and business tours, a house party and a speech to the Women\u2019s March at the State Capitol.\n\u201cIf we change who\u2019s at the decision-making table, we change everything,\u201d she told the crowd at the march. (Ms. Gillibrand also said there was \u201cno room for anti-Semitism\u201d in the Women\u2019s March movement, a reference to the controversy involving one of the original march organizers that has caused fewer national Democrats to attend this year.)\nImage\nMs. Gillibrand at a brewery in Des Moines on Saturday. Her views on gun control and immigration have changed since she was elected as a U.S. Representative in rural New York.\nCredit\nRachel Mummey for The New York Times\nUnlike Senator Elizabeth Warren, another Democratic contender, who has mostly avoided mentioning Mr. Trump on the campaign trail, Ms. Gillibrand offered plenty of direct attacks on the president, saying he had brought a \u201cdarkness\u201d on the nation, using words like \u201cheartless,\u201d \u201cimmoral,\u201d \u201cinhumane\u201d and \u201cbeyond disgraceful,\u201d and citing his \u201cracist message.\u201d\nOf the federal shutdown under Mr. Trump, she said, \u201cHe\u2019s doing it all for himself and his own ego.\u201d\nBut almost as often as she mentioned her voting record against Mr. Trump\u2019s agenda or appointments, Ms. Gillibrand cited her across-the-aisle work with Republicans, including how she bonded with Senator Joni Ernst, an Iowa Republican, at Bible study, and name-dropping her alliance with Senator Ted Cruz, the Texas Republican reviled by many Democrats, in her legislative battles on sexual assault in the military.\n\u201cI can work with anybody,\u201d she said to laughs after mentioning Mr. Cruz.\nIn Boone, a town of about 12,500 people, a 43-year-old Iowan, Chris Bennett, asked Ms. Gillibrand to say what separated her most from what could be a sprawling field of two dozen or more Democratic candidates in 2020.\n\u201cI really believe that I can bring this country together,\u201d she began her answer.\nVoters mostly responded positively.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had enough divisiveness over the last couple years,\u201d said Amy Young, a college professor, whom Ms. Gillibrand pitched about finding common ground at a coffee shop in Ames. \u201cWe are one country. We need to remember that.\u201d\nLinda Santi, who met Ms. Gillibrand in Sioux City, said: \u201cShe talked about running in a red congressional district. That was important to me. How do we talk? How do we engage Trump voters in civil discourse?\u201d\nMs. Santi saw Ms. Warren on her recent visit \u2014 Iowans famously love to size up their presidential candidates in person before making a decision \u2014 and said Ms. Gillibrand\u2019s arrival was far more \u201cdownscale\u201d: no street vendors hawking goods, no organized selfie line.\n\u201cWarren was pressing the populist button in more of an us-them kind of way,\u201d Ms. Santi said.\nIn Sioux City, Ms. Gillibrand did get a question about her decision to become the first Democratic senator to call for the resignation of the former senator Al Franken in late 2017 following multiple allegations of sexual misconduct. Some Democratic donors and activists had lamented his departure and her role in it.\n\u201cEnough was enough,\u201d Ms. Gillibrand said of the final allegation.\n\u201cAl Franken was entitled to whatever process he wanted,\u201d she said. \u201cIf he wanted to stay and wait six months for his ethics hearing, he was entitled to whatever he wanted. His decision was to resign. My decision was not to remain silent.\u201d\nSeveral people at her events said they learned much of what they know about her from television appearance this week, including on Rachel Maddow\u2019s show on MSNBC, where Ms. Gillibrand was a guest. Ms. Maddow opened the interview by dissecting Ms. Gillibrand\u2019s shifting stances.\n\u201cTell me about that transformation,\u201d Ms. Maddow pointedly began her questioning.\n\u201cI understand her policy positions have evolved,\u201d said Rick Mullin, 65, who attended the house party with Ms. Gillibrand in Sioux City. He was sympathetic. His positions have shifted, too. \u201cNot as much as hers have,\u201d he added.\nMs. Gillibrand remains widely unknown. People quietly asked each other who the blonde woman with the media entourage was at a coffee shop in Des Moines. And as she entered the state Capitol for the Women\u2019s March speech, the security guard asked her, \u201cSo when are you running for president?\u201d\n\u201cRight now!\u201d she replied.", "html": "<html>\n <body>\n  <div class=\"css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn\">\n   <div class=\"css-4w7y5l\">\n    <p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">\n     BOONE, Iowa \u2014 Senator Kirsten Gillibrand represents one of the biggest and bluest states in America, anchored by the nation\u2019s largest urban metropolis.

He tried to reach beyond his base of supporters \u2014 which polls have begun to show is losing patience with him as the partial shutdown drags into its fifth week \u2014 and speak to a broader swath of Americans.\nThe Saturday afternoon speech from the West Wing was an attempt by Mr. Trump to, at the very least, shift the narrative of the past several weeks and show that rather than spoiling for a longer shutdown fight or making unreasonable demands, he was looking for a broadly acceptable way out of a morass he once boasted he was proud to wade into.\n\u201cI think you could tell by the president\u2019s remarks today,\u201d Vice President Mike Pence said, \u201cthat we\u2019re reaching out.\u201d\nYet in seeking to inch toward the center, Mr. Trump alienated portions of his hard-right base, the core supporters he most depends on and the group he and his closest aides have most feared losing. That raised the possibility that, in his zeal to get out of an intractable situation, he may have landed himself in the worst of all worlds, without a clear solution or the support of his most ardent followers.\nThe tensions and anger over the policy have been quietly playing out in the West Wing as well, as Jared Kushner, the president\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser, fended off Stephen Miller, the architect of much of Mr. Trump\u2019s immigration agenda. Mr. Kushner has long been a proponent of protections for undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children, while Mr. Miller has pressed for aggressive measures to crack down on both legal and illegal immigration.\nIn recent days, as White House officials had been working out the details of the compromise, Mr. Miller intervened to narrow the universe of immigrants who would receive protection, according to people familiar with the internal discussions who described them on the condition of anonymity.\nWhile the original idea had been to include protections for as many as 1.8 million undocumented immigrants eligible for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, the Obama-era program known as DACA that protected those illegally brought to the United States as children, Mr. Trump ultimately proposed shielding only the 700,000 who are enrolled.\nMr. Kushner conceded in a briefing after the president\u2019s speech that he did not see the proposal as a solution for the DACA program, which Mr. Trump moved to rescind in 2017.\n\u201cAt this moment in time,\u201d Mr. Kushner said, \u201cthis is a good path forward.\u201d\nMany conservatives did not share that view.\n\u201cTrump proposes amnesty,\u201d the conservative commentator Ann Coulter said on Twitter. \u201cWe voted for Trump and got Jeb!\u201d she added, referring to Jeb Bush, who challenged Mr. Trump for the Republican nomination in 2016 and supported a broad immigration overhaul that would have given undocumented immigrants a path to legal status.\nStill, in the eyes of many White House officials, the prospect that Mr. Trump could use the proposal to shift blame for the shutdown and pressure Democrats to end the impasse was worth trying. Mr. Pence argued on Saturday that the speech was a \u201csincere effort\u201d by Mr. Trump to break the logjam, and he and other White House officials suggested that the measure could attract enough support to succeed from centrist Democrats fed up with the shutdown and willing to side with Republicans.\nBut such a coalition did not appear to be forming, and courting one bears considerable risk for a president who is most comfortable when he is defying convention, eschewing compromise and being hailed as a hero by supporters who often equate bipartisan deal making with weak-kneed capitulation.\nThe vast majority of Democrats knocked the approach. While many of them have pressed for measures to protect DACA recipients and immigrants living in the United States under Temporary Protected Status enacted when their countries were destabilized by war or catastrophe, most regard the proposal he put forth on Saturday as woefully inadequate. It offers only three years of protections for the DACA recipients and those who hold T.P.S., which the Trump administration has also moved to end for several countries.\n\u201cThis is not an amnesty bill,\u201d Mr. Pence said. \u201cThere is no pathway to citizenship in this proposal.\u201d\nThat was high on Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s list of reasons to call the plan \u201cunacceptable.\u201d\nThat is unlikely to matter to the president. Despite saying publicly last month that he would be proud to own a shutdown over the wall, and privately displaying confidence that his base would stick with him through the fight, Mr. Trump has been dismayed to find otherwise in recent days.\nAn NPR poll released last week showed Mr. Trump\u2019s approval ratings down and the first cracks in backing among critical supporters, including whites without a college education and white evangelicals.\nSuch pressure from what he has called the forgotten men and women who elected him and chant \u201cBuild!

The president ultimately abandoned that agreement, concerned about angering his base and after Mr. Miller and others advised him he should insist on additional immigration restrictions.\nOn Saturday night, Breitbart panned Mr. Trump\u2019s latest idea with the headline \u201cThree-Year Amnesty, Most of Border Remains Open.\u201d", "html": "<html>\n <body>\n  <div class=\"css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn\">\n   <div class=\"css-4w7y5l\">\n    <p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">\n     WASHINGTON \u2014 Immigrant advocates denounced it as cruel.

He was 95.\nHis daughter, Sarah Glazer Khedouri, confirmed his death.\nOver more than a half-century, Mr. Glazer threw himself into the middle of heated debates over such contentious issues as race, ethnicity, immigration and education, contributing to a range of professional journals and popular magazines, and writing or editing more than a dozen books. He once said that he held positions often no different from those of many others\u2019, but that he was the one who would go to meetings and speak up.\nEarly in his career, he was a co-author of two seminal works on American society, \u201cThe Lonely Crowd,\u201d with David Riesman and Reuel Denney in 1950, and \u201cBeyond the Melting Pot,\u201d with Daniel Patrick Moynihan in 1963. Later volumes included \u201cWe Are All Multiculturalists Now\u201d in 1997 and \u201cFrom a Cause to a Style: Modernist Architecture\u2019s Encounter with the American City\u201d in 2007.\nHe was also an editor at the magazines Commentary and The Public Interest, and Doubleday Anchor Books. He served on presidential task forces on urban affairs and education, and held teaching positions at Bennington College, Smith College and the University of California, Berkeley. At his death, he was a professor emeritus of sociology and education at Harvard University.\nA child of Jewish immigrants from Warsaw, Nathan Glazer was born on Feb. 25, 1923, in New York City and spent his early years in East Harlem. His father, Louis, was a garment worker, and his mother, Tilly, was a homemaker. Nathan was the youngest of seven children, and when he was 10, the family, which was crammed into a four-room apartment, moved to the wider spaces of the East Bronx.\nMr. Glazer\u2019s interest in urban affairs stemmed directly from personal experience, and his upbringing had an impact on his later ideas. His East Harlem tenement block, dominated by the iron structures of elevated trains, had no trees or green strips. It was, Mr. Glazer once said, a \u201cbad place to live.\u201d\nOnly a few blocks away was Central Park, where a boy could lose himself in the meadows and woodlands, enjoying a respite from the city\u2019s noise and grime. For Mr. Glazer, the park was a \u201cwonder\u201d of childhood, and in years to come, when some urban planners challenged Frederick Law Olmsted\u2019s vision of a pastoral retreat within a crowded city, he spoke out in Olmsted\u2019s defense.\nMr. Glazer arrived at City College in 1940, near the end of the Great Depression and at a time when the all-male, predominantly Jewish student body was largely divided into antagonistic leftist factions \u2014 Stalinist, Trotskyist, Socialist. Having inherited a Socialist, anti-Communist perspective from his trade-unionist father, Mr. Glazer lined up against the Stalinists, joined a radical Zionist organization and edited its newspaper.\nAfter graduation, in 1944, he got a job at The Contemporary Jewish Record, soon to become Commentary. Mr. Glazer, who had come out of a \u201cvery narrow world,\u201d as he put it, described his life in the late 1940s and early \u203250s as leaving \u201cthe womb.\u201d\nIn the presidential election of 1948, he voted for the Socialist Norman Thomas, not the Democrat Harry S. Truman.\nTwo groups of thinkers that have had a lasting impact on American culture had a lasting impact on Mr. Glazer as well. The first was the New York Intellectuals, the collection of writers, gathered around Partisan Review and later The New York Review of Books, who combined leftist politics with modernist aesthetics. The Partisan Review writers Dwight Macdonald and Hannah Arendt were early influences; another contributor to the magazine, the art critic Clement Greenberg, helped get him his first job.\nWhile he was at Commentary, Mr. Glazer\u2019s circle widened. Writers like James Baldwin and Irving Howe would drop by the office, and at Greenwich Village parties he met prominent intellectuals like Lionel Trilling and the Partisan Review editors Philip Rahv and William Phillips. These were people, Mr. Glazer said, who seemed to be \u201cworking at the forefront of knowledge,\u201d with their understanding of Marx, Freud and Modernist developments in the arts.\n\u201cThere was an awful lot of talk,\u201d Mr. Glazer said, but he had always felt that he was something of an outsider, a \u201cjunior member\u201d at these get-togethers, \u201cmore like a hanger-on\u201d than a full participant.\nMr. Glazer\u2019s turn to neoconservatism followed an almost paradigmatic path. Throughout the 1950s, and even after he went to work for the Kennedy administration\u2019s Housing and Home Finance Agency in 1962-63, he continued to consider himself a radical. But if, as his longtime friend Irving Kristol put it, a neoconservative is a liberal who has been mugged by reality, then Mr. Glazer got hit over the head.\nHe had taken a teaching post at Berkeley in 1963, just as the student rebellions of the 1960s were erupting. Opposed to the growing American military involvement in Vietnam and supportive of social policies designed to help the poor, he initially sympathized with the student protesters. But as they grew more extreme \u2014 \u201cnihilistic\u201d was Mr. Glazer\u2019s word \u2014 he turned away from them and his own leftist past as well. He moved toward what he saw as a hard-won pragmatism but what others saw as a reactive conservatism.\nImage\nMr. Glazer, second from right, at a symposium in Boston on diversity in the academy in 1998. During the 1990s he decided that he had been wrong about the course of integration, as set out in his book \u201cAffirmative Discrimination,\u201d and concluded that some kind of multiculturalism was necessary for public education.\nCredit\nSuzanne Kreiter/The Boston Globe via Getty Images\nIn 1965, Mr. Glazer became one of the original contributors to The Public Interest, founded by Mr. Kristol and another friend, Daniel Bell. The magazine was a policy journal grounded in the concreteness of empirical evidence and asked hard questions about Great Society programs.\nIt became the most intellectually formidable of the neoconservative publications in the last decades of the 20th century, and one that Mr. Glazer edited with Mr. Kristol from 1973 until its demise in 2005.\nMr. Glazer\u2019s first marriage, to Ruth Slotkin, ended in divorce. He is survived by his wife, Sulochana (Raghavan) Glazer; three daughters from his first marriage, Sarah Glazer Khedouri, Elizabeth Glazer and Sophie Glazer; seven grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.\nDuring the battles of the 1970s over busing and affirmative action, Mr. Glazer published \u201cAffirmative Discrimination\u201d (1975), a landmark statement for neoconservatives and others opposed to government-enforced racial balancing. Mr. Glazer was prominently featured in one of the earliest studies of the group, Peter Steinfels\u2019s \u201cThe Neoconservatives: The Men Who Are Changing America\u2019s Politics\u201d in 1979.\nMr. Glazer was never an entirely reliable neoconservative. He wasn\u2019t comfortable with the label, and on foreign policy he continued to describe himself as \u201csomewhat left.\u201d If he opposed policies like affirmative action, it was not, as with more traditional conservatives, out of antipathy to government itself, but out of a skepticism about what public programs could accomplish.\nOne of his books was entitled \u201cThe Limits of Social Policy,\u201d published in 1988.\n\u201cOn most areas of public policy,\u201d he said, \u201cI consider myself pragmatic, rather than a man of the left or a man of the right.\u201d\nAs a social scientist, Mr. Glazer valued hard facts over good intentions. At the same time, he was modest about what the facts could show. A reader of his work was always coming upon phrases like \u201cI am not sure\u201d and \u201cWe do not have the knowledge\u201d and \u201cI do not know.\u201d\nThis meant that the nonideological Mr. Glazer could change his mind. In his writings on architecture and city planning, for example, he went from early enthusiasm for modernism to a \u201cgrowing disenchantment.\u201d\n\u201cIn the end,\u201d he said, \u201cthe defense of a radical modernism became the work of an elite that the ordinary person could not understand.\u201d\nDuring the 1990s Mr. Glazer decided that he had been wrong about the course of integration as set out in \u201cAffirmative Discrimination\u201d \u2014 that he had been complacent about racial progress in America.\nAnd once he had concluded that some kind of multiculturalism was necessary for public education, he bowed to what he saw as the inevitable: \u201cEven the most balanced and professional effort to define a curriculum for students in American schools today will place a heavy emphasis on multiplicity and diversity, race and ethnicity.\u201d\nIn Mr. Glazer\u2019s case, it seemed, a multiculturalist was a neoconservative who had been mugged by reality.\nFormer allies were not pleased. One historian of neoconservatism, writing in 2005, spoke of Mr. Glazer\u2019s \u201cdefection\u201d from the movement.\nYet there was an underlying consistency to Mr. Glazer\u2019s political and policy shifts. He had become a pessimist about the effectiveness of government programs and therefore a critic of much social policy. \u201cI know what I\u2019m against,\u201d he said.\nBut he said this more with sorrow than satisfaction. For if his skepticism compelled him to leave most of his radical past behind, he never fully abandoned his youthful concerns about social justice.\nLate in life he described himself as a \u201cmeliorist,\u201d and in a statement that can stand as his political testament, he declared: \u201cI think you must keep on trying, even if you haven\u2019t had great success. I think everything helps a little.\u201d", "html": "<html>\n <body>\n  <div class=\"css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn\">\n   <div class=\"css-4w7y5l\">\n    <p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">\n     Nathan Glazer, one of the country\u2019s foremost urban sociologists, who became most closely identified with the circle of disillusioned liberals known as the neoconservatives, died on Saturday at his home in Cambridge, Mass.

Speaker Nancy Pelosi rejected it even before Mr. Trump spoke, and Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader, denounced the offer as \u201cnot a compromise but more hostage taking.\u201d\nWith the shutdown entering its fifth week and polls showing a majority of the public blaming Mr. Trump, the president\u2019s advisers have been searching for an exit strategy. Saturday\u2019s speech grew out of talks that Vice President Mike Pence and the president\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, have had in recent days with lawmakers including Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader.\nThe proposal was Mr. Trump\u2019s first public offer to Democrats since the partial shutdown began nearly a month ago. It came after an acrimonious week of tit-for-tat politics, in which Ms. Pelosi told the president he could not deliver his State of the Union address in the Capitol until the shutdown was over, and the president retaliated by grounding a plane that was supposed to take Ms. Pelosi on a fact-finding mission to Afghanistan.\nIn casting the plan as a compromise, the president sought to shift pressure to Democrats \u2014 who have repeatedly refused to give Mr. Trump any money for his border wall \u2014 to end the shutdown. But Democrats continued to insist they will not negotiate with Mr. Trump over border security until the government reopens.\nOver the course of his administration, Mr. Trump has repeatedly sought to curb both legal and illegal immigration. He has revoked Temporary Protected Status, or T.P.S., which offers crucial protections for immigrants, for people from some Latin American and African countries. And he has moved to rescind Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, an Obama-era program that shielded the young undocumented immigrants known as Dreamers from deportation.\nIn the deal he outlined on Saturday, Mr. Trump offered to restore T.P.S. protection for 300,000 people, and said he would allow 700,000 Dreamers to keep their protections for three more years in exchange for $5.7 billion for a border barrier.\n\u201cThat is our plan,\u201d Mr. Trump said. \u201cBorder security, DACA, T.P.S. Many other things. Straightforward, fair, reasonable and common sense with lots of compromise.\u201d The proposal, Mr. Trump added, was intended to \u201cbreak the logjam and provide Congress with a path forward.\u201d\nThe speech was the second time during the shutdown that the president addressed the nation about the immigration crisis. But unlike his first address, a prime-time broadcast from the Oval Office that leaned heavily on dark messaging about the dangers of crime and illegal drugs flowing across the border, Mr. Trump seemed on Saturday to soften his tone.\nHe paired the address with his first naturalization ceremony at the White House, a move intended to underscore the idea that he supports legal immigration. And his language was markedly different; instead of insisting on the \u201cbig beautiful wall\u201d he promised during his 2016 campaign, Mr. Trump took care to use the word \u201cbarrier\u201d as well \u2014 and seemed to pare back his vision for it.\nCalling the wall \u201ca powerful and beautifully designed see-through steel barrier on our southern border,\u201d Mr. Trump said: \u201cThis is not a 2,000-mile concrete structure from sea to sea. These are steel barriers in high priority locations. Much of the border is already protected by natural barriers such as mountains and water.\u201d\nMr. Trump noted that he had adopted some Democratic proposals on border security. The president proposed $800 million for humanitarian assistance and $805 million for drug detection technology, in addition to funding for 2,750 more border agents and law enforcement officials and 75 new immigration judge teams.\nIn her talking points, issued to Democrats, Ms. Pelosi said her party favored \u201cnew drug, weapons and contraband scanning technology at official ports of entry,\u201d and \u201cfilling the more than 3,000 vacancies for customs officers.\u201d Ms. Pelosi also intends to bring up legislation in the coming days that includes an additional $1 billion for border security, including $563 million for 75 new immigration judges and support staff.\nEven so, Democrats roundly criticized the president\u2019s plan. They were particularly incensed that Mr. Trump\u2019s offer extended protections to Dreamers and T.P.S. recipients that he himself revoked. And they said the deal was a nonstarter because it did not offer any permanent protections for Dreamers.\n\u201cI think it\u2019s simply more fake promises raising false hopes,\u201d Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, said. \u201cIt will fool few Americans because it\u2019s neither serious nor credible as a real remedy for Dreamers.\u201d\nThe Border Wall: What Has Trump Built So Far?\nThe existing barrier isn\u2019t a single mile longer than it was when he took office.\nJan. 5, 2019\nSome on the right also pushed back, describing the proposal as amnesty. James Carafano, a national security expert at the Heritage Foundation who worked on Mr. Trump\u2019s transition, was among the critics. \u201cAmnesty encourages further illegal immigration, incentivizes the tragedy of human trafficking and undermines our citizens\u2019 confidence in the rule of law,\u201d he said.\nMr. Pence, briefing reporters after Mr. Trump\u2019s remarks, said the speech reflected a painstaking process of listening to lawmakers, including rank-and-file Democrats who made it clear they believed that protections for DACA and T.P.S. recipients must be included in a border security deal.\nAnd he pushed back forcefully against critics like Mr. Carafano who said the measure amounted to an unacceptable amnesty for undocumented immigrants.\n\u201cThere is no pathway to citizenship in this proposal,\u201d Mr. Pence said.\nBut that was one reason many Democrats considered it unacceptable. Other senior administration officials made it clear that part of Mr. Trump\u2019s strategy was to try to drive a wedge within the party between those who want to hold out for a much more generous solution and those who may feel enough political pressure to end the shutdown that they will feel obliged to support it.\nNoting that Tuesday is the deadline for the government to reopen in time to prevent federal employees from going a second consecutive pay period without a check, Mick Mulvaney, the acting chief of staff, said Senate Democrats had a tricky decision to make. He also noted that the president\u2019s ability to declare a national emergency was \u201cabsolutely\u201d still a tool available to Mr. Trump to find funds to build the wall if a legislative agreement could not be reached.\nNow it will be up to Mr. McConnell to put legislation incorporating Mr. Trump\u2019s proposal on the Senate floor.\nMr. McConnell \u2014 who has insisted he will not put any legislation on the floor unless the president will sign it \u2014 spoke to Mr. Trump, Mr. Kushner and Mr. Pence on Thursday night about finding a way forward.\nMr. McConnell told the president that before he could bring up legislation on the Senate floor, he needed a \u201cpublic reassurance\u201d that Mr. Trump would sign it, one person close to the talks said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to describe sensitive discussions.\nThe president\u2019s proposal \u201cstrikes a fair compromise by incorporating priorities from both sides of the aisle,\u201d Mr. McConnell said in a statement after Mr. Trump\u2019s speech.\nIf Mr. McConnell does indeed put a bill on the floor, as the president said he would, Senate Democrats will have to decide whether to block it or let it come up for a vote. Despite Democrats\u2019 vow to reject the measure, it could create an opening for negotiations between the two sides.\nThe shutdown stalemate is creating increasing nervousness on Capitol Hill, especially among Republicans seeking re-election in Democratic-leaning states. One of them, Senator Susan Collins of Maine, is among only a handful of Republicans who have broken with the president and called for the government to reopen without a border security deal.\nOn Saturday, she praised the president, saying she hoped that Mr. Trump\u2019s offer would \u201clead to constructive debate that will end this impasse.\u201d\nWhite House aides and allies of Mr. Trump said Saturday that Mr. Trump succeeded in ratcheting up the political pressure on Ms. Pelosi, especially if the Senate succeeded in passing a bill.\n\u201cThe Democrats\u2019 talking points have been that the president is solely responsible for shutting down the government,\u201d Marc Short, the former White House legislative director, said. \u201cThis puts more onus on them to come back and say why this proposal is insufficient.\u201d\nBut one reason Democrats are so leery of the deal is that they have been down this road with the president before. Last year, Mr. Trump and Mr. Schumer negotiated $25 billion in wall money for a pathway to citizenship for the Dreamers. But that deal fell apart when hard-line White House advisers persuaded the president to back away.\nThe standoff over the shutdown, some former aides noted, was the first time Mr. Trump has had to engage in meaningful, high-stakes negotiations.

And now, they are quietly asserting their influence as the partial government shutdown, which has left them scrambling to explain why 800,000 workers are still without pay, enters its fifth week.\nThe centrists, elected to seats held last year by Republicans, delivered Democrats their House majority, and their re-elections will be critical to keeping the party in power. They include a sizable subset with backgrounds in military, intelligence and national security, and won by promising to work across the aisle and to end dysfunction in Washington. Now they are caught in the most dysfunctional situation of all \u2014 a record-breaking shutdown \u2014 and they are under pressure from constituents to do something about it.\n[The Latest: In White House Address, Trump Proposes DACA Deal in Exchange for Wall Funding]\nThis past week, a group of freshmen in Trump-leaning districts convened a private strategy session to discuss how they could press Speaker Nancy Pelosi to reclaim the issue of border security for Democrats and to open the door to negotiations with President Trump. Some also aired their frustrations with Representative Hakeem Jeffries, the chairman of the Democratic caucus, who hosted a small dinner for freshmen from battleground districts.\n\u201cWe have very real credibility on the border security issue,\u201d said Representative Jason Crow, Democrat of Colorado and a former Army ranger. \u201cI did two combat deployments to Afghanistan. Both of those were on the Afghan-Pakistan border interdicting drug and gun smuggling and insurgents coming across from Pakistan and the tribal regions. So I like to think I know a thing or two about border security, and you don\u2019t do it by building walls.\u201d\nMs. Pelosi appears ready to listen. When Congress returns to Washington in the coming week, she is expected to bring up legislation that will include an additional $1 billion for border security measures, including 75 additional immigration judges and infrastructure improvements at ports of entry \u2014 though no money for Mr. Trump\u2019s cherished border wall.\nShe is also weighing whether to propose a Democratic homeland security bill that could lay the foundation for talks with Mr. Trump \u2014 a step that would be a significant shift in strategy for the new majority, which has instead spent the past several weeks emphasizing the shutdown\u2019s emotional and financial toll on unpaid workers.\n\u201cAs someone who worked on preserving the homeland her entire life, I\u2019m ready to talk about homeland security,\u201d said Representative Elissa Slotkin, Democrat of Michigan, a former Pentagon official who also served in the C.I.A., and who organized the strategy session. \u201cI don\u2019t think we need a wall from sea to shining sea. But am I willing to talk about more fencing and more drones and technology and radar and border agents? Absolutely.\u201d\nOf the roughly 60 new Democrats in Congress, two-thirds, including a tight-knit group of 10 who are either veterans or have national security experience, flipped Republican seats. They represent a very different face of the party: pragmatic moderates who believe they were elected not just to resist the president but also to cooperate with him where they can.\n\u201cEvery single one of them ran on a platform of going out to Washington, shaking things up and getting things done,\u201d said Representative Cheri Bustos of Illinois, a member of Democratic leadership who focuses on electing Democrats in Trump districts. \u201cFrom the day they were sworn in, the government has been shut down, and they don\u2019t like it and the people they represent don\u2019t like it.\u201d\nSeveral of the freshman Democratic centrists, all members of a bipartisan group called the Problem Solvers Caucus, met with Mr. Trump at the White House this past week.

Mr. O\u2019Rourke had not endorsed Ms. Jones. In fact, he had elevated her Republican opponent, Representative Will Hurd, with frequent praise and, most memorably, a live-streamed bipartisan road trip that helped jump-start their midterm campaigns. Would Mr. O\u2019Rourke support the Democrat?\nHe would not.\n\u201cThis is a place where my politics and my job and my commitment to this country come into conflict,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Rourke said. \u201cI\u2019m going to put country over party.\u201d\nSome supporters of Ms. Jones saw it differently: Beto O\u2019Rourke was once again putting Beto O\u2019Rourke first.\nFive months later, as Mr. O\u2019Rourke considers a run for president, his decision not to back Ms. Jones lays bare the go-it-alone streak that has defined his career, separating him from a modern Democratic Party that has prized near-uniform opposition to Republicans in Washington. While supporters view his above-the-fray message as the foundation of his appeal, he has left important Democratic constituencies wondering if he can be fully trusted as an ally.\n\u201cBeto-first politics,\u201d said Jess Morales Rocketto, a Democratic operative who worked for Hillary Clinton in 2016. \u201cHe was concerned about Beto. I\u2019m not sure he was concerned about building the future of Democratic politics.\u201d\nIn Texas\u2019 23rd Congressional District, his choice was more than symbolic. Mr. Hurd won by fewer than 1,000 votes, and many voters and local activists hold Mr. O\u2019Rourke \u2014 whose success helped lift down-ballot candidates across the state \u2014 largely responsible for Ms. Jones\u2019s defeat.\n\u201cAll I kept thinking was, wait, Beto is supposed to be helping us because he\u2019s a Democrat,\u201d said Rosey R.

Though Mr. O\u2019Rourke stayed neutral, Ms. Jones drew high-wattage help in the race, including from prominent Texas Democrats like Juli\u00e1n Castro, the former housing secretary who is running for president, and Wendy Davis, the former candidate for governor and abortion-rights activist.\nAsked whether Mr. O\u2019Rourke had a special responsibility to support a female candidate of color in this Democratic moment, Ms. Davis sounded almost anguished.\n\u201cIt\u2019s really hard to say,\u201d she said, adding that she did not mean to \u201cback-seat drive\u201d a friend\u2019s decision-making. \u201cI would feel that special duty. I personally would feel that. Beto\u2019s not me, and I\u2019m not Beto.\u201d\nMr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s very presence as a would-be presidential contender for 2020 is an issue of heated debate within the party. He is a prolific fund-raiser who proved he can energize younger voters, and some early polls place him third behind Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Senator Bernie Sanders, well ahead of many more decorated politicians. But he is also a relatively inexperienced lawmaker who lost his Senate race against Ted Cruz.\nFor close watchers of Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s rise, his approach to Ms. Jones\u2019s contest captured the twin pillars of his political worldview: He has an instinct for performative campaigning, reaching for multiplatform connection to voters but often lurching toward extreme oversharing. (Mr. O\u2019Rourke was widely mocked recently after turning the camera on his own dental appointment.)\nAnd he has often defied the wishes of his fellow Democrats, especially traditional party leaders, who have eyed him warily since he challenged a Democratic incumbent in 2012 to reach Congress in the first place.\nThrough a fluke of weather, timing and internet trendsetting, Mr. Hurd sits at the intersection of it all. Until March 2017, he and Mr. O\u2019Rourke had been friendly enough as district neighbors, but never especially close. Then, after a snowstorm grounded their flights from Texas to Washington, Mr. O\u2019Rourke suggested they drive instead \u2014 and record themselves for all 1,600 miles, answering questions from followers along the way.\nAlone in their rented Chevy Impala, they sang along to Willie Nelson, hashed out health care and trade policy and made a late-night doughnut run in Tennessee, attracting hundreds of thousands of viewers and wide-scale media coverage. Newt Gingrich called in to salute them. Mark Zuckerberg chimed in approvingly on Facebook.\nImage\nIn early 2017, Mr. O\u2019Rourke and Representative Will Hurd, a Republican, live-streamed a road trip from Texas to Washington.\n\u201cOur party leadership is probably not super excited that we\u2019re doing this,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Rourke said at one point.\nHe was half right. Democrats in Washington, who had eyed Mr. Hurd\u2019s seat as a prime pickup opportunity after Mrs. Clinton carried the district in 2016, winced at the sight of Mr. O\u2019Rourke bolstering Mr. Hurd\u2019s reputation for bipartisanship.

Bush, said by email that the road trip became a \u201clife preserver for Hurd and launchpad for Beto.\u201d\nMr. O\u2019Rourke and his team seemed to recognize this. The ride registered as his campaign\u2019s unofficial kickoff. And he was quick to invoke his relationship with Mr. Hurd, to deflect attacks from Mr. Cruz that he was too far left for Texas, and to burnish his self-styled standing as a high-minded antidote to the Capitol\u2019s seemingly intransigent partisanship.\n\u201cI know how disappointing it is to people,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Rourke said in an interview last summer, explaining his decision not to support Ms. Jones. \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing for very legitimate, really important reasons. Like, I also want to be in the majority.\u201d\nHe added that Ms. Jones would make an excellent congresswoman if elected.\nParty officials and activists kept up the pressure, cornering him at rallies and fund-raisers, including one in San Antonio where Mr. O\u2019Rourke raised his right hand in a mock ceremony and pledged not to make Mr. Hurd \u201clook cool\u201d even as he refused to oppose him.\n\u201cBasically I told him he needed to dance with who brung him,\u201d said Mary Bell Lockhart, the chairwoman of the Brewster County Democratic Party. \u201cAnd it was primarily Democrats.\u201d\nImage\nMr. O\u2019Rourke is a prolific fund-raiser who proved he can energize younger voters.

(Mr. Hurd has been a rare Republican opposing the construction of a wall.)\nBut Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s history with the party is more complicated than it appeared in a binary race against Mr. Cruz, whom Democrats could generally agree to loathe. He was known in Washington for declining to pay dues to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. In 2016, he voted against Nancy Pelosi to lead the Democratic caucus, supporting Tim Ryan, a centrist from Ohio.\n\u201cWe are all products of our environment,\u201d said Pete Gallego, a former Democratic congressman who lost his seat to Mr. Hurd in 2014. \u201cHe has found tremendous success by shaking things up and by not being part of the party apparatus.\u201d\nAfter Ms. Jones won the Democratic nomination for the seat, she and Mr. O\u2019Rourke had a cordial conversation by telephone. Mr. O\u2019Rourke neither pledged to help Ms. Jones nor told her directly that he would be withholding his support, according to people briefed on the call.\nIn late June, Ronald Smith, a liberal activist in Mr. Hurd\u2019s district, emailed Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign demanding to know: \u201cHas Beto endorsed Gina Ortiz Jones? If not, when will he endorse her?\u201d Mr. Smith said he wanted \u201ca team player for my next Democratic senator.\u201d\nAn O\u2019Rourke campaign representative offered a noncommittal reply in an email reviewed by The New York Times: \u201cWe are evaluating some local and regional races at this time.\u201d\nBy the summer, aides to Mr. O\u2019Rourke had made clear to Ms. Jones\u2019s campaign that he would not support her candidacy, three Democrats familiar with the exchange said. Mr. O\u2019Rourke valued his relationship with Mr. Hurd and was mentioning it frequently on the campaign trail, as he sought to win crossover support from right-of-center voters.\nMs. Jones, who has said she is likely to run again in 2020, declined through an aide to be interviewed about Mr. O\u2019Rourke.\nMr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s defenders note that several Democrats benefited from his stronger-than-expected showing against Mr. Cruz, helping the party flip congressional seats in the Houston and Dallas areas.\nBut in no other swing district was Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s allegiance in question. Mr. O\u2019Rourke carried the 23rd District even as Mr. Hurd narrowly won re-election there. In the section of the district that spills into Bexar County, home to San Antonio, Mr. O\u2019Rourke outperformed Mr. Cruz by about 3,900 votes, a review of precinct-level election results found. The same set of precincts voted for Mr. Hurd over Ms. Jones by nearly 4,700 votes. Mr. Hurd won the district by just over 900 votes.\n\u201cWe know exactly what the Beto bump was and it was amazing,\u201d said Mr. Smith, the liberal activist. \u201cBut my assessment was, for Democrats, as well as we did this last election cycle, we would have had one more seat if Beto had been on board with Gina Ortiz Jones.\u201d", "html": "<html>\n <body>\n  <div class=\"css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn\">\n   <div class=\"css-4w7y5l\">\n    <p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">\n     For a moment in August, an event hall in Texas teemed with hope, taquitos and unity.\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">\n     <html>\n      <body>\n       <p>\n        It was a border-town stop for Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s Senate campaign, but another Democratic politician commanded particular attention: Gina Ortiz Jones, a history-making congressional candidate \u2014 gay, Filipina-American, an\n        <span class=\"pos-link\">\n         Iraq\n        </span>\n        war veteran \u2014 hoping to turn a majority-Hispanic district blue. \u201cReally special person,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Rourke said, as Ms. Jones stood and waved.\n       </p>\n      </body>\n     </html>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">\n     But soon, a county chairwoman posed an uncomfortable question.

And he was quick to invoke his relationship with Mr. Hurd, to deflect attacks from Mr. Cruz that he was too far left for Texas, and to burnish his self-styled standing as a high-minded antidote to the Capitol\u2019s seemingly intransigent partisanship.\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">\n     \u201cI know how disappointing it is to people,\u201d Mr. O\u2019Rourke said in an interview last summer, explaining his decision not to support Ms. Jones. \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing for very legitimate, really important reasons.

He was known in Washington for declining to pay dues to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. In 2016, he voted against Nancy Pelosi to lead the Democratic caucus, supporting Tim Ryan, a centrist from Ohio.\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">\n     \u201cWe are all products of our environment,\u201d said Pete Gallego, a former Democratic congressman who lost his seat to Mr. Hurd in 2014. \u201cHe has found tremendous success by shaking things up and by not being part of the party apparatus.\u201d\n    </p>\n   </div>\n   <aside class=\"css-1m2ozyi\">\n    <span>\n    </span>\n   </aside>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"css-u5vfum StoryBodyCompanionColumn\">\n   <div class=\"css-4w7y5l\">\n    <p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">\n     After Ms. Jones won the Democratic nomination for the seat, she and Mr. O\u2019Rourke had a cordial conversation by telephone. Mr. O\u2019Rourke neither pledged to help Ms. Jones nor told her directly that he would be withholding his support, according to people briefed on the call.\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">\n     In late June, Ronald Smith, a liberal activist in Mr. Hurd\u2019s district, emailed Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign demanding to know: \u201cHas Beto endorsed Gina Ortiz Jones? If not, when will he endorse her?\u201d Mr. Smith said he wanted \u201ca team player for my next Democratic senator.\u201d\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">\n     An O\u2019Rourke campaign representative offered a noncommittal reply in an email reviewed by The New York Times: \u201cWe are evaluating some local and regional races at this time.\u201d\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">\n     By the summer, aides to Mr. O\u2019Rourke had made clear to Ms. Jones\u2019s campaign that he would not support her candidacy, three Democrats familiar with the exchange said. Mr. O\u2019Rourke valued his relationship with Mr. Hurd and was mentioning it frequently on the campaign trail, as he sought to win crossover support from right-of-center voters.\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">\n     Ms. Jones, who has said she is likely to run again in 2020, declined through an aide to be interviewed about Mr. O\u2019Rourke.\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">\n     Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s defenders note that several Democrats benefited from his stronger-than-expected showing against Mr. Cruz, helping the party flip congressional seats in the Houston and Dallas areas.\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"css-1ygdjhk evys1bk0\">\n     But in no other swing district was Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s allegiance in question. Mr. O\u2019Rourke carried the 23rd District even as Mr. Hurd narrowly won re-election there. In the section of the district that spills into Bexar County, home to San Antonio, Mr. O\u2019Rourke outperformed Mr. Cruz by about 3,900 votes, a review of precinct-level election results found. The same set of precincts voted for Mr. Hurd over Ms. Jones by nearly 4,700 votes.
